				<h1>QUESEE - A DIFFERENT KIND OF TEST AUTOMATION TOOL</h1>

				<h2>PROBLEM TO SOLVE</h2>

                <p>In the first days from starting on a new job, I got the task to fix some of the issues the company
                    had with an internal test automation tool. The problems were not trivial and were mostly created by
                    the large amounts of data loaded in the web page, the persistence mechanism that used a lot of space
                    on the drive and the comparison algorithms that did not cover all the cases and sometimes gave false
                    positives.</p>

                <p>There was no other way around this but to rewrite a significant part of the application to optimize
                    the traffic between the server and the browser and also to persist smaller and more flexible data
                    structures.</p>

                <p>I thought this was the perfect opportunity to propose a new design of the entire application,
                    including a brand new user interface. I can say I was lucky to get the approval for such an
                    ambitious plan, given the fact that most companies don't invest more than necessary in their
                    internal tools and on top of that, I had zero web development experience at that time.</p>

                <p>In a nutshell, the application is a record/replay tool for the communication between the components of the
                    system. The communication consists of serialized Java objects that are passed between components on
                    specific requests. The tool is based on the idea that recordings will be done when the system is in
                    a stable state and compared against the traffic within the system at a future date to see if there are changes.</p>

                <a class="fancybox" rel="before" title="Homepage" href="img/quesee/before/homepage.png"><img class="gallery3" id="before_1" src="img/quesee/before/homepage.png" alt="" /></a>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="before" title="Scenarios" href="img/quesee/before/scenarios.png"><img class="gallery3" id="before_4" src="img/quesee/before/scenarios.png" alt="" /></a>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="before" title="Scenario view" href="img/quesee/before/scenario-view.png"><img class="gallery3" id="before_3" src="img/quesee/before/scenario-view.png" alt="" /></a>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="before" title="Scenario run" href="img/quesee/before/scenario-run.png"><img class="gallery3" id="before_2" src="img/quesee/before/scenario-run.png" alt="" /></a>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="before" title="Test view" href="img/quesee/before/test-view.png"><img class="gallery3" id="before_5" src="img/quesee/before/test-view.png" alt="" /></a>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="before" title="Test run" href="img/quesee/before/test-run.png"><img class="gallery3" id="before_6" src="img/quesee/before/test-run.png" alt="" /></a>

				<p>For those of you not familiar with test automation, I will describe it to you in a nutshell.</p>

                <span id="moreOrLessAutomation">
				<p>The needs of such a testing tool gravitate along these lines :
					<ul>
                        <li>Record communication</li>
                        <li>Replay and compare baseline vs actual results</li>
                        <li>Visualize comparison results, there are three types of results : success, failure and
                            ignored)
                        </li>
                        <li>Investigate the failures</li>
                        <li>Fix tests that are providing a wrong assessment</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>There are some notions that need to be defined before going further : </p>
					<table class="definitions">
                        <tr>
                            <td class="key">API</td>
                            <td class="value">description of an interaction with the service, defined by the name of the request, the
                                type of input it needs and the type of the output it provides
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="key">API call</td>
                            <td class="value">a specific request issued to the system through an API.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="key">Component</td>
                            <td class="value">a collection of APIs grouped to service requests of a similar nature.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="key">Scenario</td>
                            <td class="value">a collection of API calls that are needed to support a scenario that the user
                                goes through.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="key">Suite</td>
                            <td class="value">collection of scenarios grouped around a similar need or functionality</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>

                </span>

                <h2>SKETCHES</h2>

                <p>So I started by sketching some ideas I had after discussing with the original author of the
                    application where he explained to me the purpose of the tool and some of the ways it is being used
                    by the Quality Assurance team.</p>

                <p>I played around the idea of having a tree of items on the left and a larger area on the right to
                    display more information about the selected item from the tree.</p>
                <a class="fancybox" rel="sketches" title="Suite view" href="img/quesee/after/sketches/suite.jpg"><img class="gallery3" id="sketches_1" src="img/quesee/after/sketches/suite.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                <a class="fancybox" rel="sketches" title="Scenario view" href="img/quesee/after/sketches/scenario.jpg"><img class="gallery3" id="sketches_2" src="img/quesee/after/sketches/scenario.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                <a class="fancybox" rel="sketches" title="Test view" href="img/quesee/after/sketches/test.jpg"><img class="gallery3" id="sketches_3" src="img/quesee/after/sketches/test.jpg" alt="" /></a>

                <p>The tree would display two different groupings of the collection of tests (by Component and by Suite)
                    and would also provide contextual actions on mouse over for each type of item.</p>

                <a class="fancybox" rel="sketches" title="Test grouping" href="img/quesee/after/sketches/explorer.jpg"><img class="gallery1" id="sketches_4" src="img/quesee/after/sketches/explorer.jpg" alt="" style="width : 300px; margin-right:auto; margin-left: auto;"/></a>

                <p>I also wanted to have the most important actions like recording, replaying and reports easy to access
                    and make the state of the application visible all the time so the users will get better feedback and
                    feel in control of the situation.</p>

                <a class="fancybox" rel="sketches" title="Replaying and recording tests" href="img/quesee/after/sketches/motion.jpg"><img class="gallery1" id="sketches_5" src="img/quesee/after/sketches/motion.jpg" alt="" /></a>

                <p>These drawing may not make too much sense for now but things will become more clear in the next section so please bear with me.</p>

				<h2>WIREFRAMES</h2>

                <p>After having a clearer idea of how I wanted the application to look like, I created a series of
                    wireframes in order to communicate with the remote team I was working for and ask for their
                    feedback.</p>

                <a class="fancybox" rel="wireframes" title="Suite selection" href="img/quesee/after/wireframes/1.suite_view.png"><img class="gallery3" id="wireframes_1" src="img/quesee/after/wireframes/1.suite_view.png" alt="" /></a>
                <a class="fancybox" rel="wireframes" title="Scenario selection" href="img/quesee/after/wireframes/2.scenario%20view.png"><img class="gallery3" id="wireframes_2" src="img/quesee/after/wireframes/2.scenario%20view.png" alt="" /></a>
                <a class="fancybox" rel="wireframes" title="Test selection" href="img/quesee/after/wireframes/3.step_view.png"><img class="gallery3" id="wireframes_3" src="img/quesee/after/wireframes/3.step_view.png" alt="" /></a>

                <p>One of the most important design decision that I took to solve the performance issue was to represent
                    the objects in a hierarchical form, as a tree, and use a progressive disclosure approach when
                    loading the data in the web page.
                    This way, even though the user deals with large objects, expanding a node from the tree will only
                    load the closest descendants, minimizing the traffic and making the page snappier. This is also an
                    improvement from a usability stand point since the user has now a better overview of the data and
                    can choose more easily what part of the object to inspect.</p>

                <a class="fancybox" rel="wireframes" title="Run all tests" href="img/quesee/after/wireframes/4.run_all_view.png"><img class="gallery3" id="wireframes_4" src="img/quesee/after/wireframes/4.run_all_view.png" alt="" /></a>
                <a class="fancybox" rel="wireframes" title="Record tests" href="img/quesee/after/wireframes/5.record_colapsed_view.png"><img class="gallery3" id="wireframes_5" src="img/quesee/after/wireframes/5.record_colapsed_view.png" alt="" /></a>
                <a class="fancybox" rel="wireframes" title="Recorded test expanded" href="img/quesee/after/wireframes/6.record_expanded_view.png"><img class="gallery3" id="wireframes_6" src="img/quesee/after/wireframes/6.record_expanded_view.png" alt="" /></a>

                <p>As you can see, the wireframes are not complete and do not cover all the possible scenarios, but this
                    was enough to get the conversation started, get some feedback and start to develop the new user
                    interface.</p>

                <p>I used Balsamiq for creating the wireframes and it worked great for this project.</p>

				<h2>IMPLEMENTATION</h2>

                <p>Starting from the wireframes and from the feedback I got from the users, I began to implement the
                    design. There was no hi fidelity prototype stage since there was no need for a more polished version and more
                    that that, I liked the look and feel of the wireframes that make for a flat UI without bells and
                    whistles but also with a scent of playfulness and friendliness coming from the round corners and
                    lively colours.</p>

                <p>It took more than a few months for the design to come to life and there were a lot of tiny additional
                    design decisions that were made along the way to accommodate all the requirements.</p>

                <h3>Visualizing and Editing tests</h3>

                <p>Some of the screens are still not implemented but I added them anyway to showcase a flow and to see
                    how the user drills down the test explorer section from the left.</p>

                <p>Please notice the contextual actions that come to life when the mouse is over a row and how they
                    differ from situation to situation (e.g. the test explorer has actions for running, ignoring and
                    deleting tests while the object explorer has actions for shuffling collections and reverting
                    changes).</p>

                <a class="fancybox" rel="implementation" title="Suite view" href="img/quesee/after/implementation/1.suite_view.PNG"><img class="gallery4" id="impementation_1" src="img/quesee/after/implementation/1.suite_view.PNG" alt="" /></a>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="implementation" title="Scenario view" href="img/quesee/after/implementation/2.scenario_view.PNG"><img class="gallery4" id="impementation_2" src="img/quesee/after/implementation/2.scenario_view.PNG" alt="" /></a>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="implementation" title="Test view" href="img/quesee/after/implementation/3.test_step_view.PNG"><img class="gallery4" id="impementation_3" src="img/quesee/after/implementation/3.test_step_view.PNG" alt="" /></a>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="implementation" title="Test editing" href="img/quesee/after/implementation/4.test_step_editing.PNG"><img class="gallery4" id="impementation_4" src="img/quesee/after/implementation/4.test_step_editing.PNG" alt="" /></a>

                <p>Modifying a test is necessary in situations where the expected result has changed over time and needs
                    to be updated. To do that, the user has to double click an existing value and type in a new one instead,
                    technique also known as in-place editing. Please notice the consistency of the visual tags and the
                    save button that appears only when needed.</p>

                <h3>Test Execution History</h3>

                <p>The colored chart displays the history of the test executions. Besides displaying information, it is
                    also used for selecting a particular test execution in order to investigate the reasons behind the
                    result. By selecting a test execution, a comparison tree is displayed right bellow the chart.</p>

                <p>I have written a different article about the <a href="test_history.html">history chart</a> since
                    there is an interesting design story behind it.</p>


                <h3>Recording and Replaying tests</h3>

                <p>The whole idea behind the two most important features of the application was to provide immediate
                    feedback and have the status of the application visible all the time. I used animation to convey the
                    busy state of the system by the way of spinning icons. This is less noticeable in the screenshots
                    than it is in the real application.</p>

                <a class="fancybox" rel="implementation" title="Recording tests" href="img/quesee/after/implementation/7.recording_sceanrio.PNG"><img class="gallery2" id="impementation_7" src="img/quesee/after/implementation/7.recording_sceanrio.PNG" alt="" /></a>
                <a class="fancybox" rel="implementation" title="Run all tests" href="img/quesee/after/implementation/5.running_tests.png"><img class="gallery2" id="impementation_5" src="img/quesee/after/implementation/5.running_tests.png" alt="" /></a>

                <h3>Comparing Objects</h3>

                <p>The comparison view leverages the object explorer view and decorates the tree elements with visual
                    annotations in order to convey the changes.</p>

                <p>In order to make the comparison work along the progressive disclosure nature of the tree, the changes
                    need to bubble up so that the user knows how to drill down in order to find them. This is done by
                    adding a red dotted underline to the element that needs to be expanded in order to find the change.
                    I used the same visual cue found in most spell checkers to convey that something is wrong.</p>

                <a class="fancybox" rel="comparison" title="Test failure" href="img/quesee/after/implementation/6.exploring_test_failure1.png"><img class="gallery3" id="comparison_1" src="img/quesee/after/implementation/6.exploring_test_failure1.png" alt="" /></a>
                <a class="fancybox" rel="comparison" title="Test failure" href="img/quesee/after/implementation/6.exploring_test_failure2.png"><img class="gallery3" id="comparison_2" src="img/quesee/after/implementation/6.exploring_test_failure2.png" alt="" /></a>
                <a class="fancybox" rel="comparison" title="Test failure" href="img/quesee/after/implementation/6.exploring_test_failure3.png"><img class="gallery3" id="comparison_3" src="img/quesee/after/implementation/6.exploring_test_failure3.png" alt="" /></a>

                <p>This is very different from the side by side view of the
                    previous version of the application and it has both
                    advantages and disadvantages. The pros are the ease of implementation and integration in the new
                    design. The con is the color coding that needs to be learned by the users.</p>

                <h3>Reports</h3>
                <p>This is definitely a section that can be improved and I am still not happy with the implemented solution.</p>
                <p>I started from the following two ideas </p>
                <a class="fancybox" rel="implementation" title="Reports proposal" href="img/quesee/after/implementation/reports_variations.png"><img class="gallery1" id="reports_variations" src="img/quesee/after/implementation/reports_variations.png" alt="" /></a>

                <p>and I ended up implementing this version.</p>

                <p>The good thing about the implemented solution is that is uses the same flat and clean design and also consistent colors, icons and interactions.</p>

				<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

                <p>The tool has been adopted by the Quality Assurance team and it has been in use for most than a year
                    at the time I wrote this article.</p>

                <p>Most of the complaints were related to the server functionality. There were also some issues
                    with the user interface, like the <a href="test_history.html">history chart</a> that became unusable
                    until redesigned and the
                    colours used in the comparison view that were creating confusion for some of the
                    users.</p>

                <p>Even though the tool is in a pretty good shape, there are some improvements that are requested
                    by the users and will probably be implemented in the future:
                <ul>
                    <li>a side by side comparison view</li>
                    <li>a way of editing the expected result directly from the comparison view</li>
                    <li>hide the actions that don't make sense in some scenarios</li>
                    <li>drag and drop support in the test explorer tree for moving scenarios between suites</li>
                    <li>search and filter the test explorer tree</li>
                    <li>display reports as a hierarchy instead of a flat list</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>All in all, I had a great time designing, implementing and improving this tool and I sure learned a
                    lot during the process.</p>
