Current version improvments:

- Typeface is really heavy, look at adding more weights for clear heirachy between titles and content   PARTIALLY DONE
- navigation links don't change color on hover/active
- improve link color contrast, the current colors are not working on all screens
- change hamburger menu icon to a more condensed version        DONE
- make the default entry to your project page, Grab the attention using your project page. I'm really not interested about reading someone's bio until I am impressed
- Apply your process on top of your project page. UX is big on process and strategy. consider having another page about the design process.
- Don't mention you're a part-time designer. Make it a full-time (at least state that). Also, why Java UI? Are you targeting java-based apps? If not, I would remove it.
- There is a lot of text in the right pane and attention span of individuals these days is not much. Picture speaks a thousand words. So try making homepage richer by screenshots and videos etc.
- fix the content with an english teacher, the composition is a little bit childish
- write more articles with the latest designs : parking plus
- The mobile menu height animation is a little janky, also highly unnecessary for 4 items, maybe add profile picture in the menu
- change profile picture to a more professional and friendly photo      DONE
- rescan some of the old pen and paper mockups, the photos with the phone are not good enough
- add link to CV

- font rendering does not look crisp, change font and test on multiple devices
- Optimise that profile photo its 1.7mb 1700px square, you should easily get that down to ~150kb max DONE
- Combine the CSS files to lower the amount of network requests made
- test responsiveness thoroughly


Second version suggestions:
- come up with a more creative design of the site
- get inspiration from other ux portfolios, there are a ton out there
- add some interactivity, transitions, animations
- think responsive design
