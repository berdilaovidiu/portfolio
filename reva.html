        <p class="first_paragraph">Reva is a vertically integrated CRM for the US multifamily real estate market. The
            project started in 2015 when an industry player reached out to a group of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to
            co-develop a solution that leverages new technological advancements to address usability and reliability
            issues and gather actionable analytics.</p>

        <div id="team_setup" class="subtitle2">Team setup</div>
        <p>I was part of a very experienced Product team of six. We coordinated with engineering teams on three
            continents. Most of the Product team was on the US west coast while Engineering was spread across Romania,
            Costa Rica and Peru.
            I collaborated remotely with the Product team while acting as a liaison between Product and the Romanian
            Engineering teams.
        </p>

        <div id="my_role" class="subtitle2">My role</div>
        <p>I started as a UX designer, after a very thorough interview. In the beginning there was a lot of wireframing
            and design critique as we were laying the foundations of the design system and covering the main flows. The
            role quickly evolved as I began to write engineering stories, plan engineering
            sprints and validate implementations.
            As I became more familiar with the business, user needs, product vision and technological
            constraints, I took on more complex assignments that culminated with me managing Contract Renewals. It was a
            large and complex feature that took over a year to design, develop and release.
        </p>

        <p>For a brief period I took on customer support responsibilities. Being closer to users and customers really
            helped me gain a better understanding of whom I was designing for and what the priorities were.
        </p>

        <div id="highlights" class="subtitle">Highlights</div>
        <p>Most of what was designed was the result of teamwork and I cannot take full credit for it. There are however
            pieces that I owned, where my involvement was higher and where I took the lead on research, wireframing,
            validation with multiple stakeholders and coordinating with visual design and engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            I could probably write a separate article for each piece since there was a lot of design work in the three
            and a half years I contributed to the project but I am not going to do that. I will instead summarize the
            five most interesting areas that I owned.
        </p>

        <div id="inventory" class="subtitle2">Inventory</div>
        <p>There were a lot of items that a property could lease to its residents. There were appartments, parking
            spaces, storage units, boat slips, washers and dryers or common areas. like a clubhouse. Most of them came
            with pictures, descriptions, amenities, leasing history, availability and price. There were also
            relationships between them since a primary inventory like an apartment was usually rented together with
            secondary items like a parking space. Some of the items had names, like unit B-12, while others were just
            pools with an availability count like washers and dryers. Some of them were meant for long term leasing
            while others could be rented for a couple of hours, like a clubhouse for a birthday party.
        </p>
        <p>
            All this had to be captured in the design of the Inventory Details Page and this was one of the first
            assignments I got on the project. It was meant for leasing agents, resident services and managers.
        </p>

        <div id="inventory" class="subtitle2">Leasing Party Summary</div>
        <p>There were a lot of prospects in the leasing pipeline, at different stages of the process. Some of them were
            just making a first contact via phone call or by walking in the leasing office. Others were coming in to
            tour the property. Others were applying for a background check or signing a contract. In some scenarios,
            understanding the situation of a party, at a glance, ultimately improved not only the work of the leasing
            agent, but also the business outcome.
        </p>
        <p>Imagine an incoming phone call from a prospect. Even though there was a primary leasing agent assigned,
            communication via phone was routed based on party stage and agent availability. This meant that sometimes
            the call was routed to somebody new who had to pick up the conversation. Understanding the context around
            that prospect at a glance made the conversation more effective and more enjoyable at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>I experimented with multiple concepts, some of which I present here. The party page had multiple sections and
            was quite long so one idea was to summarize each section, as a small card, at the top of the page.
        </p>
        <p>Besides the information captured in the page, a lot of interesting information was buried in communication
            records: emails, text messages, phone calls and notes. Another idea was to introduce a text highlighting
            feature and display those highlights as part of the summary.
        </p>
        <p>The version that ultimately got implemented was simpler and presented only information relevant for the stage
            of the conversation.
        </p>

        <div id="inventory" class="subtitle2">Merging persons and parties</div>
        <p>The communication module automatically created person and party records for unknown contacts. So every time a
            new number called the leasing office, a new person was added to the system and a new leasing party was
            created for that person. This worked well most of the time. It was an appreciated feature but there were
            situations when it backfired.
        </p>
        <p>The wife calls to ask about availability and the system captures her contact info. During the conversation
            the agent learns about the husband and adds a second person record, with only his name to the party. Two
            days later, the husband calls to schedule a tour of the property. The system sees it as a new contact and
            creates a new person record and a new leasing party. There are now two person records for the husband and
            two leading parties for the same group of people. In order to keep the data clean and the system performing
            optimally, duplicated entities had to be merged. Easier said than done.
        </p>
        <p>The backend piece was definitely the hardest part of the job. Persons and parties had a bunch of other data
            associated with them: property, leasing team, tasks, preferences, communication, appointments, applications,
            payments, contracts, history. Coming up with rules to cover every possible combination was a huge effort
            that had Product and Engineering working closely for some time.
        </p>
        <p>The UI piece was challenging as well. The system had to suggest possible duplicates during data entry, while
            on the phone, and do it in a clear way so that the leasing agent had the confidence to trigger an
            irreversible data change while focused on the conversation. The second piece was highlighting possible
            duplicates to be reviewed on the dashboard, party and person pages.
        </p>

        <div id="inventory" class="subtitle2">Responsiveness</div>
        <p>Mobility was one of the value propositions of the system. Even though leasing agents have mostly desk jobs,
            part of the work could be happening on the move. During the commute they could do part of the planning
            tasks. During tours they could take notes or answer questions about availability, amenities or prices.
        </p>
        <p>The plan was to design a responsive UI right from the start and wrap the web app in a mobile container along
            the way, to take advantage of native functionalities of the device, like push notifications, calls and
            location.
        </p>
        <p>Designing a responsive enterprise web app is not very straightforward. Some of the screens were quite
            information dense and there was quite a bit of task concurrency e.g. taking notes, searching for available
            units and scheduling a tour while on the phone with a prospect. Things like communication flyouts, side
            panels and tables were quite challenging as well.
        </p>

        <div id="inventory" class="subtitle2">Renewals</div>
        <p>Once the MVP of the leasing module was successfully deployed at a dozen properties, the first step towards
            the Resident Services module was Contract Renewals. It was an obvious choice because it leveraged existing
            pricing and contract implementations. The more tricky parts were integrating with the legacy systems in
            order to pull and push data and adjusting the UI and the data model to fit the new workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
            The UI had to account for a separate dashboard and for ways to switch between the leasing and RS dashboards
            seamlessly. The party page had to evolve to accommodate multiple workflows that could be sequential or
            parallel in nature e.g. a resident party could be transferring to a different unit during the renewal
            period.
        </p>

        <div id="inventory" class="subtitle">Learnings</div>
        <p>During the three and a half years working on this project I grew immensely. This happened mostly because the
            company was led by well versed designers with startup experience. I think the most important learning was to
            link every design decision to business metrics. If it’s not going to affect the bottom line, it’s not
            worth the effort.
        </p>
        <p>Secondly, I need to involve the engineering team quite early in the process to get feedback and buy-in. There
            were a couple of occasions in the beginning when I presented pixel perfect work for the first time during
            sprint planning and it backfired badly. I had either worked outside of the technical constraints and the
            proposal was worthless or the team felt left out and showed a lot of resistance in accepting the
            requirements.
        </p>
        <p>Collaboration is probably the most important design skill. At times it felt like communication and people
            skills weigh more than design skills. No matter how good the solution is for the final user, it needs a lot
            of alignment internally in order to see the light of day. It is also the responsibility of the designer and
            they don't teach you this in school.
        </p>
