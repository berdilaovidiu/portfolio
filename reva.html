				<p class="first_paragraph">Reva is a vertically integrated CRM for the US multifamily real estate market. The project started in 2015 when an industry player reached out to a group of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to co-develop a solution that leverages new technological advancements to address usability and reliability issues and gather actionable analytics.</p>

				<div id="team_setup" class="subtitle2">Team setup</div>
				<p>I was part of a very experienced product team of six. We coordinated with engineering teams on three continents. Most of the product team was on the US west coast and engineering was spread accross Romania, Costa Rica and Peru.
					I collaborated remotely with the product team while acting as a liaison between Product and the Romanian engineering team.
				</p>

				<div id="my_role" class="subtitle2">My role</div>
				<p>I started as a UX designer, after a very thorough interview. In the beginning there was a lot of wireframing and design critique as we were laying the foundations of the design system and covering the main flows. The role quickly evolved into someting more complex as I began to write engineering stories, plan engineering sprints and validate implementations.
					As I became more familiar with the business and user needs, with the product vision and technological constraints I took on more complex Product assignments that culminated with me managing Contract Renewals, a large and complex feature that took over a year to design, develop and release.
				</p>

				<p>For a brief period I took on custumer support responsibilities. Being closer to users and customers really helped me gain a better understanding of whom I was designing for and what the priorities were.
				</p>

				<div id="highlights" class="subtitle">Highlights</div>

				<p>Most of what was designed was the result of teamwork and I cannot take full credit for it. There are however pieces that I owned, where my involvement was higher and where I took the lead on research, wireframing, validation with multiple stakeholders and coordinating with visual design and engineering.</p>

				<p>I could probably write a separate article for each piece since there was a lot of design work in the three and a half years I contributed to the project but I am not going to do that. I will instead summarize the 5 most interesting areas that I owned.</p>

				<div id="inventory" class="subtitle2">Inventory</div>

				<p>There were a lot of items that a property could be renting to itâ€™s residents. There were appartments, parking spaces, storage units, boat slips, washers and dryers or common areas like a clubhouse. Most of them came with pictures, descriptions, amenities, leasing history, availability and price. There were also relationships betwwen them since a primary inventory like an appartment was usually rented together with secondary items like a parking space. Some of the items had names, like unit B-12, while others were just pools with an availability count like washers and dryers. Some of them were meant for long term leasing while others could be rented for a couple of hours, like a clubhouse for a birthday party.</p>

				<p>All this had to be captured in the design of the Inventory Details Page and this was one of the first assigments I got on the project. A leasing agent would see a page like this, as well as a resident services person or a manager.</p>

					</a>
				</div>

				<div class="subtitle2" id="party_summary">Leasing Party Summary</div>

				<p>There were a lot of prospects in the leasing pipeline, at different stages of the process. Some of them were just making a first contact via phone call or by walking in the leasign office, others were coming in to tour the property or were more advanced and were applying for a background check or already signing a contract. There were multiple scenarios where understanding the situation of a particular party, at a glance, ultimately improved not only the task of the leasing aget but also the business outcome. </p>

				<p>One example of such a scenario is an incoming phone call from a prospect. Even though there was a primary leasing agent assigned, communication via phone was routed based on party stage and agent availability. This meant that sometimes the call was routed to somebody different than the primary leasing agent and that person had to pick up the conversation. Understanding the context around that prospect at a glance made the conversation more effective and more enjoyable at the same time.</p>


				<div class="subtitle2" id="party_person_merge">Person and  Party Merge</div>
				<p>The communication module automatically created person and party entities for unknown contacts. So every time a new number called the leasing office, a new person was added to the system and a new leasing party was created for that person. This worked well most of the time and it was an appreciated feature but there were scenarios when it backfired.</p>
				<p>The wife calls to ask about availability. The system captures her contact info, the agent learns about the husband and adds a second person record with his name. Two days later, the husband calls to schedule a tour of the property. The system sees it as a new contact and creates a new person record and a new leasing party. There are now two person records for the husband and two leasing parties for the same group of people. In order to keep the data clean and the system performing optimally, the duplicated entities had to be merged. Easier said than done. </p>
				<p>The backend piece was definitely the hardest part of the job. Persons and parties had a bunch of other data associated with them: property, leasing team, tasks, preferences, communication, appointments, applications, payments, contracts, history. Coming up with rules to cover every possible combination was a huge effort that had product and engineering working closely for some time.</p>
				<p>The UI piece was challenging as well. The system had to suggest possible duplicates during data entry, while on the phone and do it in a clear way so that the leasing agent had the confidence to trigger an irreversible data change. The second piece was highlighting possible duplicates to be reviewed on the dashboard, party and person page.</p>



				<div class="subtitle2" id="responsiveness">Responsiveness</div>
				<p>Mobility was one of the value propositions of the system. Even though leasing agents have mostly desk jobs, part of the work could be happening on the move. During the commute they could do part of the planning tasks. During tours they could take notes or answer questions about availability, amenities or prices.</p>
				<p>The plan was to design a responsive UI right from the start and wrap the web app in a mobile container along the way, to take advantage of native functionalities of the device, like push notifications, calls or location.</p>
				<p>Designing a responsive enterprise web app is not very straightforward. Some of the screens were quite information dense and there was quite a bit of task concurency e.g. taking notes, searching for available units and scheduling a tour while on the phone with a prospect. Things like communication flyouts, side panels and tables were quite challenging.</p>


				<div class="subtitle2" id="renewals">Renewals</div>
				<p>Once the MVP of the leasing module was succesfully deployed at a dozen properties, the first step towards the Resident Services module was contract renewals. It was an obvious choice because it leveraged existing pricing and contracts implementations. The more tricky parts were integrating with the legacy systems in order to pull and push data and adjusting the UI and the data model to fit the new workflow.</p>
				<p>The UI had to account for a separate dashboard and for ways to switch between the leasing and RS dashboards seamlessly. The party page had to evolve to accomodate multiple workflows that could be sequential or parallel in nature. A resident party could be transfering to a different unit during the renewal period.</p>

				<div class="subtitle"  id="final_thoughts">Final thoughts</div>

				<p>During the three and a half years working on this project I grew immensely. This happened mostly because the company was lead by well versed designers with startup experience. </p>

				<p>I think the most important learning was to link every design decision to the business metrics. If itâ€™s not going to affect the bottom line, itâ€™s not worth the effort.</p>

				<p>Secondly, I need to involve the engineering team quite early in the process to get feedback and buy-in. There were a couple of occasions in the beginning when I presented pixel perfect work for the first time during sprint plannings and it backfired badly. I had either worked outside of the technical constraints and the proposal was worthless or the team felt left out during the process and showed a lot of resistance in accepting the requirements.</p>

				<p>Collaboration is probably the most important design skill. At times it felt like communication and people skills weight more than design skills. No mather how good the solution is for the final user, it needs a lot of alignment internally in order to see the light of day. That is also the responsibility of the designer and they dontâ€™t teach you this in school.</p>
