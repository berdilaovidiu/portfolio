				<p>When I got involved in this project, a beta version had already been released and the feedback received
				from the early adopters was not great, both in terms of functionality and usability.
					The plan was to analyze the findings and come up with an improved design to take care of the shortcomings of
				the first prototype.</p>

				<p>The primary need was way for scientists analyze RNA-Seq experiments in order to find interesting isoforms,
				along with their involvement in various diseases and biological functions, all backed by published evidence.</p>

				<div class="subtitle">Previous beta version</div>

				<p>The prototype released as a beta version had already done the heavy lifting in terms of converting the
				datasets to the right format, creating the data structures, analyzing the data and finding the evindence from a large
				knowledge base of manually curated content.</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<a data-fancybox="original"
					   data-caption="Screenshot with the beta version."
					   href="img/isoprofiler/Screen%20Shot%202016-04-07%20at%204.13.21%20PM.png">
						<img class="gallery1" src="img/isoprofiler/Screen%20Shot%202016-04-07%20at%204.13.21%20PM.png"/>
					</a>
				</div>

				<p>The major issue was the presentation of the results that was done by the way of a huge filterable table with
					a two level hierarchy. More than that, a large part of the input data couldn't be analyzed because by that
					point not a lot had been published on isoforms, so it was left out from the results, creating confusion
					and indignation for the users.</p>

				<div class="subtitle">Research</div>

				<p>Since I was not familiar with the biological context around the new feature, I had to do a lot of research to
				truly understand what isoforms are, how they are measured, the limitations of the current technologies and the
				challenges scientists face when dealing with the new type of experiment data. This gave me a pretty good idea
				on the tools and processes, as well as the terminology and the visual language used in the filed.</p>

				<p>Having done the research, I was ready to review the user interviews done on the beta release. Luckily, I had recordings of
				three participants who offered a lot of good feedback that allowed me to identify the main pain points
					and some interesting new opportunities.</p>

				<span class="article_list">The main takaways were:</span>
				<ul class="article_list">
					<li>focus needs to be on the isoform expression data instead of the little literature evidence
						available</li>
					<li>the large volumes of data are hard to digest and a drill down approach is preferable</li>
					<li>there are very specific data patterns of interest</li>
				</ul>


				<div class="subtitle">Visual isoform representation</div>

				<p>In order to make the interesting expression data patterns easy to spot, I took a more visual approach
				and experimented with multiple ways of displaying quantitative data.</p>

					</a>
				</div>

				<div class="subtitle2">Molecules view</div>

				<p>The solution needed to work for singular experiments, as well as for multiple experiments that were
					being analyzed side by side. That is the reason why all the following mockups have both single and multiple datasets.</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<a data-fancybox="ideas"
					   data-caption="Dataset view variations"
					   href="img/isoprofiler/dataset_view_variations.png">
						<img class="gallery1" src="img/isoprofiler/dataset_view_variations.png"/>
					</a>
				</div>

				<p>All the above ideas were discussed and ultimately abandoned for various reasons. The version that
					survived and made it in the final product is based on colored circles of proportional size and color.
					This worked best because it was the most scalable of the approaches. The design needed to scale both
					horizontally and vertically in order to accommodate tens of isoforms of the same molecule and up to 20
					experiment conditions.</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<a data-fancybox="ideas"
					   data-caption="Preferred dataset view design"
					   href="img/isoprofiler/dataset_view_4.png">
						<img class="gallery1" src="img/isoprofiler/dataset_view_4.png"/>
					</a>
				</div>

				<div class="subtitle2">Isoforms view</div>

				<p>Once an interesting molecule has been identified in the molecules view, it can be explored in more
					detail in the isoforms view. This table offers precise information about expression measurements,
					various annotations and a visualization to help the user make sense of the data easier and also observe
				    interesting trends.
				</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<a data-fancybox="ideas"
					   data-caption="Isoforms view variations"
					   href="img/isoprofiler/isoforms_view_no_margins.png">
						<img class="gallery1" src="img/isoprofiler/isoforms_view_no_margins.png"/>
					</a>
				</div>


				<p>The first version uses a line chart that makes it easy to notice patterns like isoform switching, a
                    pattern highly demanded by beta testers. The other two versions use a stacked approach that has the
                    advantage of being an additive representation and variations of the overall molecule expression can
                    be tracked along variations of the individual isoforms.</p>

                <p>We decided to go with the first version because it was the more recognizable visualization, made patterns
					easier to notice and needed less vertical space, which turned out to be very important because it competed
					with two potentially large tables.</p>

				<div class="subtitle">The filters</div>

				<p>Even though the molecules table design was improved to make data easier to consume, it was still hard
					to navigate a space of thousands of molecules, looking for patterns. Filters were also available in
					the beta version, but I decided to move away from the table column filters in order to be able to use
				 criteria across multiple properties and to have the filters always visible.</p>

				<div class="subtitle">Conclusions</div>

				<p>The revised version project lasted for about three months and I was involved mostly in the design,
					but also some of the implementation around datasets, filters and table visualizations.</p>

				<p>The beta version was very valuable because it offered us a way to get
				very important feedback. Usually, the prototype is a lot more cheaper and faster to build, but in some cases,
				it is very hard to get a genuine reaction without using real data, especially when you are dealing with large
				amounts of novel data that people don't yet know how to use.</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<a data-fancybox="final"
					   data-caption="Screenshot with the released version"
					   href="img/isoprofiler/final_mockup.png">
						<img class="gallery1" src="img/isoprofiler/final_mockup.png"/>
					</a>
				</div>

				<p>User testing was done mostly on the artistic mockups and it involved presenting multiple scenarios to
					the beta testers that were already familiar with the beta version. The feedback was very positive since we
				were addressing a lot of the issues reported by the same people.</p>

				<p>Here are some quotes from both management and beta testers during the design and development of the tool.
				Unfortunately I did not stick around long enough to have gather some feedback after the release.</p>

				<p class="pullquote-wide">It is totally coming together, and customers will really like it! I love the way it
					updates in real time (the 3 more, 2 more etc.) on the isoform circles column as you drag it wider.
					That is awesome! The up/down filter works great, immediately able to find interesting genes.
					Seeing this in action rather than as mockups is fantastic. We are definitely creating a unique tool that
					will address unmet RNA-seq needs.</p>

				<p class="pullquote-wide">That is absolutely awesome. This is so much better than how the list was before,
					where you had like the whole list of isoforms and rather breaking it down by gene, and then how you
					are showing the isoforms with the circles, I like that a lot, that's a lot more user friendly.</p>

				<p class="pullquote-wide">It is fantastic, it is way far above and beyond the improvements I thought you
					guys were making. We needed like a summary page, It needed to be more user friendly and this setup
					that you have is really good, I like it.</p>
