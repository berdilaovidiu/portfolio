				<h1>PARKING PLUS</h1>

				<h2>THE STORY</h2>

				<p>I was attending my first UX local meetup when I met the project manager of PARKING PLUS. He was there
					to present the project and find a design collaborator and I was there to find a side project to get
					some design experience, besides my full time software development job at the time.</p>

				<p>An interview and six months later, we started working together on a product that was beginning
					to have a shape. At the time I joined the project, they had already developed a mobile prototype
					and part of the backend services.</p>

				<p>I worked mostly nights and weekends and met with the team once or twice a week to sync up. Besides the
					project manager, I was in close contact with the technical lead and the remote visual designer. The high
					fidelity mobile screens and the printed marketing materials and not my work, but I contributed heavily during
					ideation and countless feedback sessions.</p>

				<h2>COMPETITOR ANALYSIS</h2>

				<p>We started by analyzing the existing parking apps, most of them from San Francisco, but also from England,
					Germany and Sweden. I spent a lot of time experiencing the competition, taking snapshots of the most
					interesting ideas and evaluating them in terms of usability and functionality. This gave us a pretty good idea
				of what's out there and where we stand with the current prototype.</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Original version with unsorted list of suggestions" href="img/parkingplus/competitive_analysis_small.png"><img class="gallery1" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/competitive_analysis_small.png" alt="" /></a>
				</div>

				<p>A lot of competitors were pointing to parking lots on a map, some of them were showing street parking as well,
					but very few were displaying availability information and almost none of them were allowing bookings.</p>

				<span>Our goal was to improve the parking experience by:</span>

				<ul class="article_list">
					<li>showing availability information for both streets and garages</li>
					<li>allowing bookings in secured lots (this became a <a href="smart_access_box.html" target="_blank">separate product</a>)</li>
					<li>offering flexible mobile payments</li>
				</ul>


				<h2>STORYBOARDS</h2>

				<p>The ability to pay in advance for a guaranteed parking spot was a big differentiator and we wanted to
					make sure we get it right from the beginning. This is why we focused a lot on the entire process of
					looking for parking, booking it and accessing the secured premises.</p>

				<p>Next you can see a driver parking in a private garage and paying on the fly</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Original version with unsorted list of suggestions" href="img/parkingplus/storyboard1.png"><img class="gallery1" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/storyboard1.png" alt="" /></a>
				</div>

				<p>and a driver accessing a previously booked garage.</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Original version with unsorted list of suggestions" href="img/parkingplus/storyboard2.png"><img class="gallery1" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/storyboard2.png" alt="" /></a>
				</div>

				<h2>THE MOBILE APP</h2>

				<p>For the second version of the mobile app we targeted the Android platform since it was the most popular
					mobile OS among the target users. Material design had just been published at that time and
				using it was a learning process for the entire team, both design and engineering.</p>

				<h3>HAND DRAWN MOCKUPS</h3>

				<p>Most of the flows and screens were sketched and discussed prior to being sent to the graphic designer.
					Again, we focused on the primary user flows like bookings and payments, revised some flows that were
					poorly designed in the first prototype, like parking availability and suggestions and covered missing
					screens, like the introductory tutorial.</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Original version with unsorted list of suggestions" href="img/parkingplus/A4%204x8%20grid1.png"><img class="gallery2 left_image with_border" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/A4%204x8%20grid1.png" alt="" /></a>
					<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Original version with unsorted list of suggestions" href="img/parkingplus/A4%204x8%20grid2.png"><img class="gallery2 right_image with_border" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/A4%204x8%20grid2.png" alt="" /></a>
				</div>

				<h3>ANDROID MOBILE SCREENS</h3>

				<div class="gallery">
					<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="sadfasdf" href="img/parkingplus/1.map.png"><img class="gallery3 left_image with_border" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/1.map.png" alt="" /></a>
					<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="sadfasdf" href="img/parkingplus/2.private%20parking.png"><img class="gallery3 center_image with_border" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/2.private%20parking.png" alt="" /></a>
					<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="sadfasdf" href="img/parkingplus/3.payments.png"><img class="gallery3 right_image with_border" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/3.payments.png" alt="" /></a>
				</div>

				<p>These are just part of the tens of screens that were refined. Some other screens can be seen in the
					animations and marketing sections.</p>

				<h3>ANIMATIONS</h3>

				<p>Transitions between screens was something I have always wanted to try and this was my chance to do it.
					Being new to this type of work, I had to get up to speed with the foundations of animation and with
					the tools that would allow me to put together a quick mockup.</p>

				<p>After doing a little research on the tools, I decided to try Pixate, which was not difficult to learn, but
					being in the first release at that time, provided me with a lot of headaches. After two months, I was
					able to cover the major screen transitions and I was happy to be done with it.</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<div class="gallery2 left_image with_border">
						<video id="interaction1" preload="metadata" width="100%">
							<source src="img/parkingplus/video/1.map-interactions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
						</video>

						<script type="text/javascript">
							addVideoControls($("#interaction1"), "map interactions");
						</script>
					</div>

					<div class="gallery2 right_image with_border">
						<video id="interaction2" preload="metadata" width="100%">
							<source src="img/parkingplus/video/3.map%20interactions%20-%20private%20area%20busy%20waiting.mp4" type="video/mp4">
						</video>

						<script type="text/javascript">
							addVideoControls($("#interaction2"), "private parking area with busy waiting");
						</script>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="gallery">
					<div class="gallery2 left_image with_border">
						<video id="interaction3" preload="metadata" width="100%">
							<source src="img/parkingplus/video/6.parking%20suggestions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
						</video>

						<script type="text/javascript">
							addVideoControls($("#interaction3"), "parking suggestions");
						</script>
					</div>

					<div class="gallery2 right_image with_border">
						<video id="interaction4" preload="metadata" width="100%">
							<source src="img/parkingplus/video/7.find%20my%20car.avi.mp4" type="video/mp4">
						</video>

						<script type="text/javascript">
							addVideoControls($("#interaction4"), "find my car");
						</script>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>I learned tons of stuff on animations during this time, but the most important lesson was to think about
					the communication between the app and the server, because those waiting times cannot be predicted and
					the transitions should incorporate them from the design phase. Luckily, I was able to adapt my original
					proposals just by adding progress bars and spinners, and tweaking the timing a little bit.</p>

				<h2>THE ADMIN WEBSITE</h2>

				<p>The backend services were not a priority during the MVP phase of the project, so the graphic web interfaces
					were mostly designed by the engineers. One exception was the dashboard, because it was being shown in
					demos and sales pitches, so it needed to look good. I took this opportunity to evolve the existing
					interface with tables of numbers into a more visual and interactive version.</p>

				<p>I started by analyzing the data that was displayed to understand the entities and the relationships between
					them in order to find suitable visualizations.</p>

				<div class="gallery">
				<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Original version with unsorted list of suggestions" href="img/parkingplus/admin_dashboard_sketch_1.png"><img class="gallery2 left_image with_border" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/admin_dashboard_sketch_1.png" alt="" /></a>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Original version with unsorted list of suggestions" href="img/parkingplus/admin_dashboard_sketch_2.png"><img class="gallery2 right_image with_border" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/admin_dashboard_sketch_2.png" alt="" /></a>
				</div>

				<p>After sketching multiple ideas, I picked the ones that made the most sense and moved to Photoshop for
					the high fidelity details. Even though the chord diagram was very attractive, we decided to dispatch
					it because it was not scalable enough.</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Original version with unsorted list of suggestions" href="img/parkingplus/admin_dashboard.png"><img class="gallery1" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/admin_dashboard.png" alt="" /></a>
				</div>

				<p>My second proposal was the one that got implemented and it was similar in terms of layout with the image above,
					it just contained more donuts, stacked bars and an interactive heatmap for parking occupancy data.</p>

				<h2>MARKETING MATERIALS</h2>

				<p>Having won exhibition stands to some major european IT shows, the Web Summit in Dublin among them, forced
					us to start working on the marketing materials, even though we were not ready to sell or had a marketing team.</p>

				<p>Writing copy and designing for print was something new as well. I wasn't thrilled to do it because I have
					never seen myself as a creative person, but I was happy to challenge myself and step outside my comfort zone.
					Turns out these too can be approached with an engineering mindset, so I started with the structure of the
					message we wanted to convey and sketched some visual ways of doing that, through a brochure and a catalog.
					</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Original version with unsorted list of suggestions" href="img/parkingplus/marketing_sketch_1.png"><img class="gallery3 left_image with_border" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/marketing_sketch_1.png" alt="" /></a>
					<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Original version with unsorted list of suggestions" href="img/parkingplus/marketing_sketch_2.png"><img class="gallery3 center_image with_border" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/marketing_sketch_2.png" alt="" /></a>
					<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Original version with unsorted list of suggestions" href="img/parkingplus/marketing_sketch_3.png"><img class="gallery3 right_image with_border" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/marketing_sketch_3.png" alt="" /></a>
				</div>

				<p>This is the version that got printed and it was the result of our team work. I contributed with writing the copy,
					choosing the pictures, providing feedback on multiple iterations, test print and bind the pages and most
					importantly, user testing with random people to see how well the message was understood and how effective it was.</p>

				<h3>THE CATALOG</h3>
				<div class="gallery">
					<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Original version with unsorted list of suggestions" href="img/parkingplus/catalog%201.png"><img class="gallery3 left_image with_border" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/catalog%201.png" alt="" /></a>
					<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Original version with unsorted list of suggestions" href="img/parkingplus/catalog%202.png"><img class="gallery3 center_image with_border" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/catalog%202.png" alt="" /></a>
					<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Original version with unsorted list of suggestions" href="img/parkingplus/catalog%203.png"><img class="gallery3 right_image with_border" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/catalog%203.png" alt="" /></a>
				</div>

				<h3>THE BROCHURE</h3>
				<div class="gallery">
					<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Original version with unsorted list of suggestions" href="img/parkingplus/flyer.png"><img class="gallery1 with_border" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/parkingplus/flyer.png" alt="" /></a>
				</div>

				<h3>THE EXPLAINER VIDEO</h3>

				<p>This project can easily be a separate case study, but I'll try to summarize it. We needed a short video
					to tell the story of the product. The video was supposed to be used in sales pitches and on the website.</p>

				<p>I proposed the script, got the green light from the management team and started working on it. We contracted
					a graphic artist to draw the characters and the application screens, went over a few iterations to make sure we have
					all the postures and the right facial expressions and in a couple of weeks I had all that was needed to
					assemble the video.</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<video preload="none" controls class="gallery1" poster="img/parkingplus/video/video-poster.png">
						<source src="img/parkingplus/video/explainer%20video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
					</video>
				</div>

				<p>The most challenging part was the editing tool, but also keeping the video short. After multiple iterations
					and almost a month, I had something worth showing.</p>

				<h2>FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>

				<p>Working on this project exceeded my expectations in many ways. I proved myself I was capable of doing a
					good job, and that was something I needed after preparing a switch from software development to UX design
					for a few years. Giving away most of my evenings and weekends for a year, for a symbolic financial incentive,
					was a personal confirmation I enjoyed this type of work and that it was a career step in the right direction.</p>

				<p>The variety of design work and team interactions also helped me grow a lot. I worked with multiple visual
					designers and graphic artists, engineers, managers, both in person and remote, and I delivered from drawings
					and sketches to wireframes, high fidelity screens, animations and copy.</p>
