				</div>

				<p class="first_paragraph">Parking Plus is a service that saves time for drivers and optimizes revenue
					for parking operators. It removes the pain of finding a parking by showing up-to-date availability
					on a map and guiding drivers to the closest available spot, in the street or in a private garage.
					The experience is further improved by integrating mobile payments and bookings.</p>

				<p>My role was to design and test the user experience for all user touch points. I collaborated closely
					with the project manager, the technical lead, and a few graphic designers, at different stages.</p>

				<p>When I joined the project, I picked up from a working iOS prototype, a consumer-focused website and
					an administration web app that had basic functionality.</p>

				<div id="competitor_analysis" class="subtitle">Competitor analysis</div>

				<p>We started by compiling a list of ranked apps from both US and European app markets. I tested and evaluated
					them in terms of Nielsenâ€™s usability heuristics to see how Parking Plus fares compared to them.
					The study resulted in a list of features that set the service apart from the rest and another list of improvements
					needed to catch up to the competition.</p>


				<div class="gallery">
					<a data-fancybox="competitors"
					   data-caption="Collection of parking applications that were part of the research."
					   href="img/parkingplus/competitive_analysis_small.png">
						<img class="gallery1" src="img/parkingplus/competitive_analysis_small.png"/>
					</a>
				</div>

				<p>A lot of competitors were pointing to parking lots on a map, some of them were showing street parking as well,
					but very few were displaying availability information and almost none of them were allowing bookings.</p>

				<span class="article_list">Our goal was to improve the parking experience by:</span>

				<ul class="article_list">
					<li>showing availability information for both street parking spaces and garages</li>
					<li>allowing bookings in secured areas (this became a <a href="smart_access_box.html" target="_blank">separate product</a>)</li>
					<li>offering flexible mobile payments</li>
				</ul>


				<div class="subtitle" id="storyboards_">Storyboards</div>

				<p>The ability to pay in advance for a guaranteed parking space was a big differentiator and we wanted to
					make sure we get it right from the beginning. This is why we focused a lot on the entire process of
					looking for parking, booking it and accessing the secured premises.</p>

				<p>I sketched some storyboards in order to keep us grounded in the user context while exploring solutions. They also
					helped the engineering team get a better understanding of the use cases.</p>

					<a data-fancybox="storyboards"

					</a>
				</div>

				<div class="subtitle" id="the_mobile_app">The mobile app</div>

				<p>For the second version of the mobile app, we targeted the Android platform since it was the most popular
					mobile OS among the target users. Material design had just been published at that time and
				using it was a learning process for the entire team, both design and engineering.</p>

				<div class="subtitle2">Hand-drawn mockups</div>

				<p>I sketched most flows and screens in order to discuss them with the team. Once we found a satisfactory solution, we sent them to the graphic designer for the final touch.
					We focused primarily on user flows like bookings and payments, revised some flows that were
					poorly designed in the previous prototype, like parking availability and suggestions, and covered missing
					screens, like the introductory tutorial.</p>

				</div>

				<p>These are just part of the tens of screens that were refined by the graphic designer. My role in this
					process was to keep in close touch and provide feedback and guidance.
					This happened over numerous Skype calls since the graphic designer was not on site, and neither was
					I most of the time.</p>

				<div class="subtitle2">Animations</div>

				<p>The need for seamless screen transitions was born from more than just aesthetic reasons. The app was
					going to be used by drivers and enforcing the navigation structure and mental model through animation became a must.</p>
				<p>I was new to this, so I had to get up to speed with the foundations of animation and with
					the tools that would allow me to put together a quick mockup.</p>

				<p>After a little research, I decided to give Pixate a try. The tool was not difficult to learn, but
					being at the first release at that time, it provided me with a lot of headaches. It took me a couple of
					months to cover the most important screen transitions and I was happy to be done with it.</p>

						</video>

						<script type="text/javascript">
							addVideoControls($("#interaction4"), "find my car");
						</script>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>I learned a lot about animations during this time, but the most important lesson was to think about
					the communication between the app and the server because those waiting times could not be predicted and
					the transitions should incorporate them from the design phase. Luckily, I was able to adapt my original
					proposals just by adding progress bars and spinners and tweaking the timing a little bit.</p>

				<div class="subtitle"  id="the_admin_website">The admin website</div>

				<p>The backend services were not a priority during the MVP phase of the project, so the web interfaces
					were mostly designed by the engineers. One exception was the dashboard because it was being shown in
					demos and sales pitches, so it needed to look good. I took this opportunity to evolve the existing
					interface with tables of numbers into a more visual and interactive version.</p>

				<p>I started by analyzing the data that was displayed to understand the entities and the relationships between
					them, in order to find suitable visualizations.</p>

				<div class="gallery">
				<a data-fancybox="admin" class="needsBorder"
                   data-caption="Sketches for an administration dashboard - part 1"
                   href="img/parkingplus/admin_dashboard_sketch_1.png">
                    <img class="gallery2 left_image with_border" src="img/parkingplus/admin_dashboard_sketch_1.png"/>
                </a>
				<a data-fancybox="admin" class="needsBorder"
                   data-caption="Sketches for an administration dashboard - part 2"
                   href="img/parkingplus/admin_dashboard_sketch_2.png">
                    <img class="gallery2 right_image with_border" src="img/parkingplus/admin_dashboard_sketch_2.png"/>
                </a>
				</div>

				<p>After sketching multiple ideas, I picked the ones that made the most sense and moved to Photoshop for
					the finer details. Even though the chord diagram was very attractive, we decided to dispatch
					it because it was not scalable enough.</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<a data-fancybox="admin" class="needsBorder"
                       data-caption="Visual design proposal with an interactive visualization for the state of the system."
                       href="img/parkingplus/admin_dashboard.png">
                        <img class="gallery1" src="img/parkingplus/admin_dashboard.png"/>
                    </a>
				</div>

				<p>My second proposal was the one that got implemented. It was similar in terms of layout with the image above,
					it just contained more donuts, stacked bar charts and an interactive heatmap for parking occupancy data over time.</p>

				<div class="subtitle" id="marketing_materials">Marketing materials</div>

				<p>Having won exhibition stands to some major European IT shows, the Web Summit in Dublin among them, we
					were forced to start working on the marketing materials, even though we were not ready to sell or had a marketing team.</p>

				<p>Writing copy and designing for print was something new for me. I wasn't thrilled at the idea because I had
					never seen myself as a particularly creative person, but I was happy to challenge myself and step
					outside my comfort zone.
					Turns out these too can be approached with an engineering mindset. I started with the structure of the
					message we wanted to convey and sketched some visual ways of doing that, by way of a brochure and a catalog.
					</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<a data-fancybox="marketing" class="needsBorder"
					   data-caption="Sketches for a catalog and a brochure."
					   href="img/parkingplus/marketing_sketch_1.png">
						<img class="gallery3 left_image with_border" src="img/parkingplus/marketing_sketch_1.png"/>
					</a>
					<a data-fancybox="marketing" class="needsBorder"
					   data-caption="Sketches for a catalog and a brochure."
					   href="img/parkingplus/marketing_sketch_2.png">

					   href="img/parkingplus/marketing_sketch_3.png">
						<img class="gallery3 right_image with_border" src="img/parkingplus/marketing_sketch_3.png"/>
					</a>
				</div>

				<p>This is the version that was printed and it was the result of our teamwork. I contributed by writing the copy,
					choosing the pictures, providing feedback on multiple graphic design iterations, and most
					importantly user testing with random people to assess how easy it was to understand the message and how effective it was.</p>

				<div class="subtitle2">The catalog</div>

					</a>
				</div>

				<div class="subtitle2">The explainer video</div>

				<p>This was the most fun part of the project. We needed a short video
					to tell the story of the product. The video was supposed to be used on the website and in sales pitches.</p>

				<p>I proposed the script, got the green light from management and started working on it. We contracted
					a graphic artist to draw the characters and the application screens. It took a few iterations to make sure we had
					all the right postures and facial expressions. A couple of weeks later I had all I needed to
					assemble the video.</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<video preload="none" controls class="gallery1" poster="img/parkingplus/video/video-poster.png">
						<source src="img/parkingplus/video/explainer%20video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
					</video>
				</div>

				<p>The most challenging part was the editing tool, but also keeping the video short. After multiple iterations
					and almost a month, I had something worth showing.</p>

				<div class="subtitle"  id="final_thoughts">Final thoughts</div>

				<p>Working on this project exceeded my expectations in many ways. I proved to myself that I was capable of doing the job,
					and that was something I needed after preparing a switch from software development to UX design
					for a few years.</p>

				<p>The variety of design work and team interactions also helped me grow a lot. I worked with multiple visual
					designers and graphic artists, engineers, managers, both in person and remotely, and I delivered from drawings
					and sketches to wireframes, high fidelity screens, animations and copy.</p>

				<p>This was a side project, something I did while having a full-time software development job. I worked mostly
					nights and weekends and met with the team once or twice a week to sync up.</p>
