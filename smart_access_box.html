				<h1>SMART ACCESS BOX</h1>

				<p>The need for smart and secured access was discovered while working on <a href="parking_plus.html" target="_blank">another product</a>.
				It made more sense to build it as a separate product, since a flexible access control solution could be used
					not only for parking lots, but also for offices, sports venues, homes, or any other area that has an electric locking mechanism.</p>

				<p>Part of the solution was a physical box that was attached to any electric lock, the other part was a
					mobile app that communicates with the box via low energy bluetooth. The access was granted based on
					flexible and shareable virtual keys.</p>

				<h2>DESIGN AND IDENTITY CONCEPT</h2>

				<p>Management wanted this to look and feel like a premium product, so I came up with a brand identity
					proposal that included advice for all the customer facing elements of the service.</p>

				<div style="margin-bottom: 19px;">
					<img src="img/pdf%20icon.png" style="vertical-align:middle;"/>
					<a target="_blank" href="img/sab/identity%20concept.pdf" style="vertical-align:middle;"> Brand Identity Concept</a>
				</div>

				<p>I also spent some time drawing the most important use cases as storyboards. This helped the design team stay
					aware of the usage context, but it also helped management in demos and sales pitches since it made it
					easy to understand how the service could be used.</p>

					</a>
				</div>


				<h2>THE LANDING PAGE</h2>

				<p>We started building the landing page even before we started talking about the mobile app. It's goal was to
					present the product, get people excited, gather some comments and feedback and ultimately get some pre orders.</p>

				<p>Since the page was going to be shared in email marketing campaigns, we expected a lot of users to see it
					on their mobile devices, so the responsiveness way key to the success of the project.
					The proposal was based on the product identity concept, using full screen high quality images with the
					solution, simple and clean copy and social proof.</p>

					<a data-fancybox="website" class="needsBorder"
					   data-caption="Sketches for the landing page, web and mobile layouts."

					</a>
				</div>

				<p>I worked closely with the visual designer on multiple iterations of the design. The images bellow only
					show the first version, the one that was tested with users and the one that was released. In between,
					there were probably close to ten versions and a lot of skype feedback sessions, since the visual
					designer was remote.</p>

				<p>We tested with five users and got some very interesting findings. Some of the users were developers on
					other projects of the company and they were a little biased because they were aware of parking startup
					I was part of, others were friends of mine who were kind enough to volunteer their time.</p>

				<h2>THE MOBILE APP</h2>

				<p>There were two types of users for the mobile app, the ones that manage the access to a secured location
				and the ones that request or make use of the granted permissions.</p>

				The consumers of the service had to be able to:
				<ul class="article_list">
					<li>see the in range secured locations</li>
					<li>make use of their permissions to open/close in range doors</li>
					<li>request access for in and out of range locations</li>
				</ul>

				The administrators of the access points had to be able to:
				<ul class="article_list">
					<li>respond to an access request</li>
					<li>define permissions to an user identified by his email address</li>
				</ul>

				<p>At the time we needed the visual design ready, we were in the process of looking for a new visual designer,
					so I had to get my hands dirty. We started with the android version, so I used material design guidelines for
					navigation, layout, typography and icons.</p>

					</a>
				</div>

				<p>The entire process, from the first sketches, to delivering the final specs was quite fast, mostly because
					the functionality was straight forward and I already had some experience with material design from a previous project.</p>

				<h2>MARKETING MATERIALS</h2>

				<p>We needed a brochure and a catalog in order to promote the project at various IT trades across Europe,
					especially the Web Summit in Dublin where we were part of the Alpha program and had a presentation booth.</p>

				<p>I met with the newly hired graphic designer, the technical lead and the project manager to brainstorm
					ideas for the design of the print materials. After that meeting I came up with proposals for both items,
					in terms of content and layout.</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<a data-fancybox="marketing" class="needsBorder"
					   data-caption="Sketches for a catalog and a brochure."
					   href="img/sab/A4%204x8%20part%201.png">
						<img class="gallery2 left_image with_border" src="img/sab/A4%204x8%20part%201.png"/>
					</a>
					<a data-fancybox="marketing" class="needsBorder"
					   data-caption="Sketches for a catalog and a brochure."
					   href="img/sab/A4%204x8%20part%202.png">
						<img class="gallery2 right_image with_border" src="img/sab/A4%204x8%20part%202.png"/>
					</a>
				</div>

				<p>After discussing the proposals, I worked closely with the graphic designer on the design that was going
					to be printed. We already had some materials in the form of high quality
					images and part of the copy. Interestingly, we decided to use the storyboards to showcase the usage
					scenarios, but my version was not good enough to be published, so they were redrawn by a more talented person.</p>

				<h3>THE CATALOG</h3>
				<div class="gallery">
					<a data-fancybox="marketing" class="needsBorder"
					   data-caption="Printed version of the catalog - part 1"
					   href="img/sab/catalog%201.png">

					</a>
					<a data-fancybox="marketing" class="needsBorder"
					   data-caption="Printed version of the catalog - part 2"
					   href="img/sab/catalog%202.png">
						<img class="gallery3 center_image with_border" src="img/sab/catalog%202.png"/>
					</a>
					<a data-fancybox="marketing" class="needsBorder"
					   data-caption="Printed version of the catalog - part 3"
					   href="img/sab/catalog%203.png">
						<img class="gallery3 right_image with_border" src="img/sab/catalog%203.png"/>
					</a>
				</div>

				<h3>THE BROCHURE</h3>
				<div class="gallery">
					<a data-fancybox="marketing" class="needsBorder"
					   data-caption="Printed version of the folding brochure."
					   href="img/sab/flyer.png">
						<img class="gallery1 with_border" src="img/sab/flyer.png"/>
					</a>
				</div>


				<h2>FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>

				<p>At the time I left the company, they were in talks for doing the first two pilot deployments. I later
					had the chance of using the service in one of the secured locations and it was a nice and rewarding experience.
					Since then, they have deployed in multiple locations from Romania and the Middle East.
