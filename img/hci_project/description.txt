This is the project that allowed me to get my online certificate for the Human Computer Interaction course from the Stanford University.

The theme of the application is CHANGE. The goal was to build an application that can help people make some changes in their lifes.

The application is focused in making a change to a healthier lifestyle by improving the way they eat, excercise and relax.

In order to do those changes the appilcation aims to educate the users and to engage them in social activities with other users concerned by health.
