				<h1>BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS SPREADSHEET</h1>

				<h2>PROBLEM TO SOLVE</h2>

				<p>This is hardly a project, but it is a nice example of how good typography can drastically
					improve the experience of the users.</p>

				<p>The task at hand was to generate a spreadsheet used internally to help content curators in their
					efforts to update some files. They had to replace the name from the second column with the most
					suitable name from the list of suggestions from the third column.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately, this had to be done manually, a few thousand times, and this motivated me to try to
					make the task as easy as possible.</p>


				<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Original version with unsorted list of suggestions" href="img/function_candidates/1.png"><img class="gallery1" id="function_candidates_1" src="img/function_candidates/1.png" alt="" /></a>

				<p>At this stage, the user is presented with a list of suggestions that need to be read, and pick the
					suggestion that makes the most sense. As you can tell, this is no easy task because it relies a lot
					on the working memory, and of course, the user needs to do 20 comparisons before picking the right
					suggestion.</p>

				<p>We can make this easier just by sorting the suggestions using a similarity metric between two
					names, so that the user only needs to focus on the first several items before making a decision.</p>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Sorted list of suggestions, based on the similarity of the names" href="img/function_candidates/2.png"><img class="gallery1" id="function_candidates_2" src="img/function_candidates/2.png" alt="" /></a>

				<p>This is a great improvement in usability, but there is still a lot of room for improvement in the
					visual department.</p>

				<h2>VISUAL SEPARATION</h2>

				<p>One of the most annoying things of the previous version is the lack of visual separation between the
					items. There are of course commas and spaces, but that is not enough.</p>

				<p>The way to achieve separation, is to present the terms in the form of a vertical list. That way, each
					term sits on a separate row and it is easily recognizable. Knowing the fact that the final
					spreadsheet will have a few thousands sections, vertical space becomes important and instead of
					having a single column, I decided to go for a two columns list.</p>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Vertical alignment of the suggestions in two columns to improve visual separation" href="img/function_candidates/3.png"><img class="gallery1" id="function_candidates_3" src="img/function_candidates/3.png" alt="" /></a>

				<p>The next step was to add some more vertical space between the sections, since the grey lines of the
					spreadsheet were not enough to make a clear distinction between these tall rows with a lot of
					content.</p>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Space added to improve separation of the rows" href="img/function_candidates/4.png"><img class="gallery1" id="function_candidates_4" src="img/function_candidates/4.png" alt="" /></a>

				<p>Now the problem becomes the order of reading inside the two columns list. Just to make sure the user
					doesn't get confused between reading from left to right or going down the first column and continuing to
					the next one, I added indices for each item.</p>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Indices added to emphasize the order" href="img/function_candidates/5.png"><img class="gallery1" id="function_candidates_5" src="img/function_candidates/5.png" alt="" /></a>

				<p>There is not much left to do in the separation department, except aligning the first column, since the
					last item is slightly shifted to the right due to the larger size of the index, and this is breaking
					the vertical flow of the information.</p>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Shifted the first nine items to the right to improve the vertical alignment" href="img/function_candidates/6.png"><img class="gallery1" id="function_candidates_6" src="img/function_candidates/6.png" alt="" /></a>

				<h2>LAYERS OF INFORMATION</h2>

				<p>The improvements thus far have been great. We now have a sorted list of suggestions where the items
					are clearly identifiable, and the rows as well.</p>

				<p>Going through the user scenario again reveals that the names of the suggested functions are still a
					little bit hard to extract from the row they sit on. We can further improve this by making the index
					and the ID information less visible, emphasizing in this way the information that is important for
					the user, the actual name of the function. The ID is also important, but only in a following
					step where the user has to fill in more information, and not here, where he has to pick
					the best name from the list.</p>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Made indices and IDs less noticeable to emphasize the important information" href="img/function_candidates/7.png"><img class="gallery1" id="function_candidates_7" src="img/function_candidates/7.png" alt="" /></a>

				<p>At this point I thought the job was done and that there was nothing else I could do to improve the
					usability. I did run through the whole scenario again, to see how easy it is to execute the task, and
					I noticed that in order to make the choice with confidence, I would try to convince myself that the order was right.
					I was actually computing the word similarity function in my mind, and that was
					exhausting.</p>

				<p>It was that moment I realized I can use the already computed similarities in a visual way, to
					convey to the user the reason behind that specific order of the suggestions.</p>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="group" title="Highlighted matching sequences to support the decision making process" href="img/function_candidates/8.png"><img class="gallery1" id="function_candidates_8" src="img/function_candidates/8.png"/></a>

				<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

				<p>This is good example of how focusing on the user's task, and changing small details, can improve the
					usability of a visual representation.
					Unfortunately, I did not get any feedback from the real users of this spreadsheet, but I am sure
					they appreciate the effort.</p>
