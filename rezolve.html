        <p class="first_paragraph">Rezolve is a marketing platform that offers a mobile shopping solution along with
            digital payments and e-marketing products. It allows brands and over 150000 merchants to leverage location
            data from geo zones and beacons and to convert visual and audio media into interactive experiences on mobile
            devices.</p>

        <div id="team_setup" class="subtitle2">Team setup</div>
        <p>Rezolve is a totally remote company with people working from all over the world. I work closely with the Head
            of UX and a visual designer. When needed, we reach out to a couple of design
            agencies to extend our capabilities. I also work with Product Managers and engineering teams to
            clarify needs, timelines and get feedback on designs.
        </p>

        <div id="my_role" class="subtitle2">Role and key achievements</div>
        <p>I was hired as a Senior UX Designer and the role has gradually gotten more complex. I am involved in most
            products of the company, I manage a couple of people and I attend and contribute to the product teamâ€™s
            meetings regularly.
        </p>

        <p>My greatest achievements are all the result of teamwork, but there are some areas where I contributed more
            and had the most ownership:
        </p>

        <ul class="article_list">
            <li>redesigned the Rezolve Experiece Portal to drastically improve usability, responsiveness, modularity,
                and provide a simpler and friendlier look and feel, all based on a solid design system.
            </li>
            <li>simplified the merchant onboarding flow from an assisted to a self-serve experience.
            </li>
            <li>enhanced the content creation flow to allow small merchants with little marketing experience to create
                effective campaigns.
            </li>
            <li>reimagined the Instant Buy flow into a simple and intuitive experience for web and mobile and worked
                with multiple design teams to produce it.
            </li>
            <li>developed a good relationship with engineering, to better understand technical constraints, provide
                guidance and review changes.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div id="showcase" class="subtitle">RXP Overhaul</div>

        <p>
            The Rezolve Experience Platform (RXP) is a web application that allows merchants to create promotional
            content. This content can take the form of mobile landing pages, lead generation forms, and purchasable
            products. Merchants can then promote their content via mobile, web, or physical experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
            I joined the company right when RXP was undergoing a redesign. The old design lacked extensibility and had
            poor responsiveness. Furthermore, it looked outdated.
        </p>
        <p>
            In less than three months, I coordinated and contributed to a complete redesign. We started with a thorough
            usability audit and addressed the most important issues based on severity and frequency. The end result was
            a fresh and user-friendly design that was highly mobile-friendly and modular, all based on a well documented
            design system.
        </p>

            </a>


        </div>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, the redesign did not come to fruition due to a sudden change in the company's focus and
            priorities. Despite this setback, we didn't let our efforts go to waste. Instead, we used our findings from
            the usability audit to identify lower-effort solutions that could be iteratively implemented in the live
            version of the product. By doing so, we were able to make incremental improvements to the platform without
            the need for a full redesign.
        </p>

        <div class="subtitle">RXP Refresh</div>
        <p>Due to our limited budget and resources, we focused on implementing small, incremental changes that would
            improve the overall user experience. While enhancing the aesthetics of our platform was one of our goals, we
            recognized that consistency, visual hierarchy, and informative empty states were critical factors in
            addressing usability issues.
        </p>

            <a data-fancybox="rxp-refresh" class="needsBorder"

            </a>
        </div>

        <p>Taking a baby steps approach was essential to the success of our project. We began by updating basic design
            elements such as typography, buttons, and navigation bars. Gradually, we tackled more complex features like
            replacing the grids and file uploaders, and eventually overhauled the content and campaign creation flows.
            Along the way, we developed a comprehensive design system that ensures consistency and reusability for
            future updates.
        </p>

        <div class="subtitle">New RXP Features</div>
        <p>
            In addition to working on our long-term refresh project, we also dedicated resources to implementing new
            features. Some of these features, such as analytics, were requested by our Product Team, while others were
            identified and promoted by our design team to align with our business goals.
        </p>

        <div class="subtitle2">Analytics</div>
        <p>
            During the ideation phase of our analytics feature, we made several breakthroughs, but the most significant
            one was shifting our primary focus from campaigns (referred to as engagements within the product) to content
            pages (called target pages in the product). We realized that while campaigns were central to the engineer's
            mental model, merchants primarily evaluate how their content is performing.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this insight, we were able to design a comprehensive solution that enabled merchants of all sizes to
            answer critical questions and optimize their ROI. While our initial data collection was limited, we released
            a simplified first version and worked closely with the PMs to file improvement requests to gather the
            necessary data for a more complete solution.
        </p>

        <div class="gallery">
            <a data-fancybox="rxp-analytics" class="needsBorder"
               data-caption="To be added"
               href="img/rezolve/RXP refresh - analytics.png">
                <img class="gallery1 with_border" src="img/rezolve/RXP refresh - analytics.png"/>
            </a>
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle2">Onboarding</div>
        <p>
            Before merchants can start selling with Rezolve, they must configure several settings, including business
            details, payment collection, inventory, delivery, physical locations, and more. This process involves
            synchronizing with multiple systems, each with different response rates, which makes designing a self-serve
            onboarder quite challenging. While the initial version was functional, it required constant supervision and
            was not ready for independent use.
        </p>
        <p>
            To address these issues, we revised the design to expose a more accurate mental model, setting the right
            expectations and helping users understand the process better. We simplified the process by eliminating any
            unnecessary configurations, progressively disclosing related settings, and using wording and visuals to
            acknowledge and manage user emotions.
        </p>
        <div class="gallery">
            <a data-fancybox="rxp-builder" class="needsBorder"
               data-caption="To be added"
               href="img/rezolve/RXP refresh - seow.png">
                <img class="gallery1 with_border" src="img/rezolve/RXP refresh - seow.png"/>
            </a>
        </div>
        <p>
            After several iterations based on internal and external feedback, the final design performed exceptionally
            well in user testing, with all subjects completing the flow with ease.
        </p>

        <div class="subtitle2">Content creation</div>
        <p>
            Small merchants faced difficulties coming up with content that looked good and performed well when faced
            with a black canvas. We collected solid evidence from production data and user testing to convince
            management that this was a problem worth solving.
        </p>
        <p>
            To address this issue, we focused on low-hanging fruit, such as improving the empty state of the editor,
            enhancing editor usability, and providing generic templates that would suit the small merchant persona.
            While a more comprehensive solution that included easier and consistent brand implementation was considered,
            we decided to shelve it as part of our regular practice of prioritizing fast-paced development and measuring
            results rather than spending months polishing new features.
        </p>
        <div class="gallery">
            <a data-fancybox="rxp-builder" class="needsBorder"
               data-caption="To be added"
               href="img/rezolve/RXP refresh - page builder.png">
                <img class="gallery1 with_border" src="img/rezolve/RXP refresh - page builder.png"/>
            </a>
        </div>
        <p>
            High-fidelity prototype testing confirmed that small merchants had a much-improved experience when starting
            from an empty canvas or from a template.
        </p>


        <div class="subtitle">Shop Beautiful Redesign</div>
        <p>
            To showcase the capabilities of the platform and sell the mobile SDK, the company had an app that needed a
            redesign. The original version had an outdated look and feel and a lot of technical debt, making it
            challenging to update with improvements and new features.
        </p>
        <p>
            The redesign goals were to reimagine the explore surroundings experience, improve the image and audio
            scanning experience, and simplify the one-click purchasing flows for new and returning customers. The app
            needed to look modern, work smoothly, and be white-labelable to achieve business goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The redesign effort involved a significant focus on visual design and transitions to achieve a modern and
            smooth user experience. The final deliverables included a solid design system that enables customization and
            extensibility.

            Selling the mobile SDK can be a challenging task, which is why the company decided to introduce a web
            version of the Instant Buy feature to help ease the process. Despite having a tight deadline of just one
            week before the engineers began coding, the team followed a rigorous process and successfully aligned a
            cross-functional team. Sketches were used as a tool to facilitate thorough conversations and shape the
            architecture of the solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this project, the visual design was guided by the chosen UI code components library, and the team
            aimed to deliver a product that was visually appealing, user-friendly, and easy to implement. Despite the
            high-pressure situation, the team was able to deliver a responsive webpage design that met all of these
            requirements.

            During the development of the MVP version of the web Instant Checkout, we also worked on improving the
            design of the feature. Our goal was to create a more visually appealing UI and enhance the layout for larger
            screens.
        </p>
        <p>
            To achieve this, we decided to change the approach from using dialogs for specific tasks such as adding a
            delivery address or a card, to using expanding and collapsing in-page sections. This allowed the user to
            remain focused on the subtask while still being able to stay within the visual context of the product page,
            creating a more seamless and simple user experience. Overall, we aimed to prioritize perceived simplicity in
            order to optimize the instant checkout experience.
