				<div>Hello, I am a Java developer looking to get involved more in the beautiful field of User Experience
					Design.
				</div>
				<div>I currently live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluj-Napoca" target="-blank">Cluj
					Napoca</a>, Romania and I am enjoying every bit of fun this beautiful city has to offer, except the
					weather that I sometimes hate, especially during the winters when it gets very cold, so cold that
					the local flasher was once caught describing himself to women.
				</div>
				<div>Being involved for a while in the software development industry and seeing the lack of knowledge
					and interest most of the companies show for the UX domain really motivates me to make a change.
				</div>
				<div>I am surrounded by smart individuals with passion for technology and it is sometimes painful to
					hear users complain about poor user experiences with the products we develop.
					I really think we can do more to earn the respect and appreciation of our users and more than that,
					make technology less scary for non technical people.
				</div>
				<div>Personally, I envision a future where everybody uses technology to make their lives less
					complicated and more enjoyable and I will proudly look back twenty years from now, thinking that I
					had a part in all this.
				</div>
				<div>I picked up the interest in design while attending a UI/UX seminar, back in 2011. I was then
					working for a company that produces software for the financial industry.
					They brought in a <a href="http://www.didi.com/">design expert</a> from the United States to teach a class about user-centered design.
					Since then, I have been working on complex and interesting user interfaces for both financial and
					bioinformatics industries.
				</div>
				<div>When I am not working, I like to travel, read, dance and watch sports. I particularly like snooker,
					combat sports and most recently, Formula 1 racing.
				</div>
