				<h1>P VALUE CHART DESIGN</h1>

				<h2>PROBLEM TO SOLVE</h2>

                <p>The idea of creating a visualization for p-values came while redesigning a dashboard with biological data.
                    It started with my curiosity to understand what the values meant and continued with taking on the challenge of making them easier to read and understand.</p>

                <p>There are actually two types of columns, one with single values and one with ranges of multiple values, represented by the start and end points of the interval.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="problem" title="The original display of the information" href="img/pvalue_chart/before.png"><img class="gallery1center" id="before1" src="img/pvalue_chart/before.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>The goals were to:
                <ul class="article_list">
                    <li>give some meaning to the numbers</li>
                    <li>make them easy to compare</li>
                    <li>accommodate individual values as well as ranges of values</li>
                    <li>display it into a widget 100 px wide so it can be used in tables and lists</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>FINDING THE MENTAL MODEL</h2>

                <p>Knowing very little about p-values, I did a little research to understand what they meant and how they are used.</p>
                <p>The p-value is defined as the probability, under the assumption of hypothesis H, of obtaining a result equal to or more extreme than what was actually observed.</p>

                <p>The smaller the p-value, the larger the significance because it tells the investigator that the hypothesis under consideration
                    may not adequately explain the observation. The hypothesis H is rejected if any of these probabilities is less than or equal to a small,
                    fixed but arbitrarily pre-defined threshold value &#x03B1, which is referred to as the level of significance.</p>

                <p>The probabilities fall under a gaussian distribution and values to the right or left of the level of significance are considered interesting.
                    There are actually three levels of significance used in practice : 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="theory" title="Gaussian distribution of the probabilities with significance levels of the p value" href="img/pvalue_chart/1.png"><img class="gallery1center" id="theory_1" src="img/pvalue_chart/1.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>Starting from this graphical representation that is used in all the literature and probably familiar to most users, I began to get rid of the chart junk and keep only the essential information.</p>

                <p>Given that the chart is symmetrical, I only kept the right side. I chose the right side because the importance of the values grows from left to right and thus made use of a commonly known convention.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="theory" title="Right side of the symmetrical visualization" href="img/pvalue_chart/2.png"><img class="gallery1center" id="theory_2" src="img/pvalue_chart/2.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>The next step was to reduce it to a one dimensional representation since the values can be placed on a single axis.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="theory" title="Single line with significance markers" href="img/pvalue_chart/3.png"><img class="gallery1center" id="theory_3" src="img/pvalue_chart/3.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>So good so far, but this line could not accommodate a wide range of values and also fit into a 100 pixel wide area. In order to fix this, I used a nonlinear scale, a logarithmic scale.
                The idea came actually after consulting with one of the scientists from the office that helped me understand the whole p-value concept.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="theory" title="Nonlinear scale with significance markers" href="img/pvalue_chart/4.png"><img class="gallery1center" id="theory_4" src="img/pvalue_chart/4.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>Even by using a logarithmic scale, the interval is limited to the right side. I chose 1E-10 as a small enough value, considering that smaller values don't need comparing.</p>

                <p>It now comes down to see weather the values are located to the left or right of the significance markers and how far away from them.</p>


                <h2>THE FIRST PROPOSAL</h2>

                <p>It was now time to place some values onto the scale and see how it looks. I decided to use a less visible
                    scale in order to make the values stand out and tested with values inside the range, as well as outside the range.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="firstProposal" title="Experimenting with different p values" href="img/pvalue_chart/5.png"><img class="gallery1center" id="firstProposal_1" src="img/pvalue_chart/5.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>This is how the very first visualization looked like, for both singular and interval values:</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="firstProposal" title="First proposal" href="img/pvalue_chart/6.png"><img class="gallery1center" id="firstProposal_2" src="img/pvalue_chart/6.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>Most of the goals were reached, except the significance levels were sometimes covered by the values.
                    I fixed this by moving the markers outside the line and increasing the contrast by using orange.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="firstProposal" title="Moving the markers outside of the line" href="img/pvalue_chart/7.png"><img class="gallery1center" id="firstProposal_3" src="img/pvalue_chart/7.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="firstProposal" title="Moving the markers outside of the line" href="img/pvalue_chart/8.png"><img class="gallery1center" id="firstProposal_4" src="img/pvalue_chart/8.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>The one thing I was not happy about wast that there was no indication that the scale is not linear and
                    that bad values sit to the left of the markers and good values to right. This had great importance because
                    values are exponentially better going to the right and the users must be aware of this in order to judge the results.</p>

                <p>The simplest solution was to annotate the scale but there was no room for that since the reel estate was limited so I decided to use the scale to convey the meaning.</p>

                <p>Using segments of different sizes was an option I considered but there was just not enough room to do it.
                    More than that, segments around the significance thresholds were too small and that is the most important area since it is the border between good and bad values.</p>

                <p>I decided to use different intensities of red and green instead:</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="firstProposal" title="Color coding for good and bad values" href="img/pvalue_chart/9.png"><img class="gallery1center" id="firstProposal_5" src="img/pvalue_chart/9.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>This was the point where all the goals were achieved but there was an inconvenience.
                    The chart was used inside an information dashboard and was stealing too much attention from the rest of the page,
                    so I had to calm it down a bit by using different shades of grey instead.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="firstProposal" title="Varying color intensity for good and bad values" href="img/pvalue_chart/10.png"><img class="gallery1center" id="firstProposal_6" src="img/pvalue_chart/10.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>After presenting the concept to the product team, I got the green light to go ahead and implement it in the product.</p>

				<h2>THE SECOND VERSION</h2>

                <p>After a while, the Product Manager got involved more in the design process and came up with some great ideas.
                    The major change he proposed was to put the emphasis on values distribution density inside the intervals because this was more important than displaying just the endpoints.</p>

                <p>Another great idea was to move the scale to the bottom and reduce the chart junk. More than that, there is now space to annotate the scale and get rid of the gradient.
                    This was something I was not considering because I was too caught up in the implementation details.</p>

                <p>His first proposal was a reversed box plot that conveyed where most of the values sit inside the interval.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="finalProposal" title="Box plot definition" href="img/pvalue_chart/stuarts_proposal1.png"><img class="gallery2" id="stuart1" src="img/pvalue_chart/stuarts_proposal1.png" alt="" /></a>
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="finalProposal" title="Revers box plots used for p value intervals" href="img/pvalue_chart/stuarts_proposal2.png"><img class="gallery2" id="stuart2" src="img/pvalue_chart/stuarts_proposal2.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>An even better set of mockups followed, a version where the box plot was replaced by individual values.
                    This is better because it allows answering more specific distribution questions and is easier to understand since there is no convention to remember.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="finalProposal" title="Replacing the boxes with dots" href="img/pvalue_chart/stuarts_proposal3.png"><img class="gallery1center" id="stuart3" src="img/pvalue_chart/stuarts_proposal3.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>Even though moving the scale at the bottom had great benefits, there was also a downside to it.
                    It was now harder to visually match the values from the first two rows to the annotations of the scale.
                    The solution was to add a visual aid to help the eye travel easier along those vertical lines,
                    by either reverting some of the scale redundancy or by showing a vertical line next to the mouse cursor.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="finalProposal" title="Solutions to aid the correlation between the scale and the values" href="img/pvalue_chart/stuarts_proposal4.png"><img class="gallery1center" id="stuart4" src="img/pvalue_chart/stuarts_proposal4.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>We decided to go for the interactive line next to the cursor.</p>

				<h2>RELEASE VERSION</h2>

                <p>The version that got released is a combination of ideas from both versions.
                    I added some transparency to the dots so that areas with greater density become more visible and
                    the visualization shows off the chart values to convey that there are more values to the right.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="release" title="Version that got released" href="img/pvalue_chart/final.png"><img class="gallery1" id="final" src="img/pvalue_chart/final.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

                <p>This was a great design exercise that allowed me to take input from both scientists and product people and
                    come up with multiple iterations to deliver the optimum solution.</p>

                <p>There were a lot of back and forth discussions with the Product Manager about the right limit of the scale,
                    the order of the values, the placement of the chart with regard to the text and so on, but we reached common ground without much effort.</p>

                <p>I haven't heard user feedback for this particular visualization but the dashboard where this is used was kindly received by everyone.</p>
