				<h1>CONTENT CURATION TOOL</h1>

				<h2>PROBLEM TO SOLVE</h2>

				<p>This is a redesign of a non-commercial content curation tool used internally to add findings (relations between
					genes and diseases) to a biological knowledge base.</p>

				<p>The application assigns articles to its users, and more than that, the articles are pre
					scanned and analyzed by a natural language processing algorithm, in order to extract and suggest the findings.
					So the users need to read the articles, than validate and enrich the findings discovered by the tool.
				</p>

				<p>This is how the tool looked like before the redesign:</p>

                <div class="gallery">
				    <a class="fancybox" rel="curation tool before" title="List of findings belonging to a research article" href="img/curation/before/snapshot-all%20findings.JPG"><img class="gallery2 left_image" id="curation_before_1" src="img/curation/before/snapshot-all%20findings.JPG" alt="" style="vertical-align: top;"/></a>
				    <a class="fancybox" rel="curation tool before" title="Form to be completed for each finding" href="img/curation/before/snapshot-finding.JPG"><img class="gallery2 right_image with_border" id="curation_before_2" src="img/curation/before/snapshot-above%20fold.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

				<p>The product has been used with success for a while, but it has started to get more and more
					complaints once more users joined, the volume of work grew and the performance dropped.</p>

				<p>After a period of complaints, and also driven by longer term plans, the company decided to rewrite the
					whole thing. Most of the complaints were performance related, but the user interface was also redesigned
					and rewritten.</p>

				<p>Even though I had no previous involvement in the project, I saw this as an opportunity to practice my
					design skills, and most importantly, to observe and interview some of the users that were located in
					the same office as me, so I volunteered to give it a try.</p>

				<h2>USER RESEARCH</h2>

				<p>The goal of the user research was to understand how the curators used the tool in their work, and
					look for pain points or other opportunities of improvement.</p>

				<p>So I asked three of the power users to walk me through their most frequent tasks and voice out
					what their were doing along the line. This was a great experience, and I got to understand the
					reasons behind their workflows much better. The sessions took no more than
					45 minutes and they were conducted individually. This gave me to perfect context to ask the right
					questions, and for them to open up and provide honest answers.</p>

				<p>One of the most interesting things was that most users took notes on a piece of paper while
					reading an article, and filled the forms in the application afterwards, because this meant less
					context switches and it was less tiring.</p>

				<p>The most important things I learned from the interviews were that:

				<ul class="article_list">
					<li>the purpose of the tool is fast data entry, the users want to spend as less time as possible
						using the application
					</li>
					<li>most of the time was spent filling the forms and waiting for the application to respond</li>
					<li>a significant amount of time was spent doing reviews of the work, to make sure the data is
						correct
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<p>The context of use was also interesting. Most curators were hired as contractors and mainly worked
					from home, on their own schedule, and were paid based on how much work they get done in a month. Some of
					them did this only part time, as a second job, for some of them, this was their main job. This means
					some of them were using the application during the day, some during the night, some would sit
					down for hours, some for shorter periods, based on their schedule and needs.</p>

				<p>For a more detailed list of observations you can read the notes I took during the observation and
					interview sessions.</p>

				<h2>WIREFRAMES</h2>

				<p>Starting from the observations, I began to think of a design that would speed up the data entry,
					minimize the repetitive work, reduce vertical scrolling, improve navigation and also make the review
					process more enjoyable and less error prone.</p>

				<p>More than that, the new design would have to follow the current workflows as users are very familiar
					with the existing tool, and slowing them down, even for a short period of time, would mean less money for
					them.</p>

				<div class="gallery">
					<a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="" href="img/curation/A4%204x8%20grid%202.png"><img class="gallery2 left_image with_border" id="curation_after_6" src="img/curation/A4%204x8%20grid%202.png" alt="" /></a>
					<a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="" href="img/curation/A4%204x8%20grid%201.png"><img class="gallery2 right_image with_border" id="curation_after_7" src="img/curation/A4%204x8%20grid%201.png" alt="" /></a>
				</div>

				<h3>ARTICLES AND FINDINGS MANAGEMENT</h3>

				<p>There was not much to change when it came to displaying lists of articles and findings. I did clean
					up the screens, removing the unnecessary lines and using visual groupings instead.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
				    <a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Home screen with the list of assigned research articles and their status" href="img/curation/after/1.homescreen.png"><img class="gallery2 left_image" id="curation_after_1" src="img/curation/after/1.homescreen.png" alt="" /></a>
				    <a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="List of findings belonging to a research article" href="img/curation/after/2.display%20findings%20for%20article.png"><img class="gallery2 right_image" id="curation_after_2" src="img/curation/after/2.display%20findings%20for%20article.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>The information layering was also improved by means of colors and typography, and also by using icons,
                    to make status of the findings more visible.</p>

                <h3>REPETITIVE WORK</h3>

                <p>The issues of repetitive work came up with every user I interviewed. There were a lot of times when
                    they would have wanted a way to pre fill the answers for multiple findings with the same value.
                    This was also enforced
                    by the protocol, since the management would not favor copy/paste jobs, with the hope of reducing
                    careless work and errors. I found it interesting that users cheated anyway, by duplicating a completed finding,
                    modifying the different answers, and rejecting the finding they were supposed to fill in the first
                    place.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Completing multiple findings with the same information to reduce time and errors" href="img/curation/after/3.display%20findings%20for%20article%20-%20fill%20multiple%20findings.png"><img class="gallery1" id="curation_after_3" src="img/curation/after/3.display%20findings%20for%20article%20-%20fill%20multiple%20findings.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>The solution I proposed involves propagating the answers of a completed finding to all the findings
                    selected from the table. By hovering one of the selected rows, an icon would show up to the right,
                    and by clicking
                    the arrow, you would get a popup with the option of selecting which answer to be multiplied.</p>

                <p>I think this is better than forcing the users to repeat some steps, since this is proven by psychology
                    research to be a recipe for errors.</p>

                <h3>THE FINDING FORM</h3>

                <p>This is the screen of the application that I was advised not to change too much. There were a few problems
                    with it nonetheless, and I tried to fix them without impacting the users in a negative way.</p>

                <p>One of the things I did not like was the lack of visual hierarchy. I wanted to make the sections and
                    subsections more distinguishable, to help context switches between the computer screen and the paper
                    notes most users took before filling in the form. I did this by using indentation, typography, and by
                    moving the mandatory marks to the left, so they would help the separation of the sections.</p>

                <p>The vertical scrolling was also a thing that came up a lot during research. I tried to fix this by
                    making better use of the horizontal space, and by compressing the suggestions so that the sections
                    would become shorter. This is also helping the visual separation.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Improved finding form that makes better use of the horizontal space and displays a better visual hierarchy" href="img/curation/after/4.finding%20form%20-%20above%20fold.png"><img class="gallery1" id="curation_after_4" src="img/curation/after/4.finding%20form%20-%20above%20fold.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>There is also a subtle change to the position of the buttons. The navigation buttons were moved to
                    the sides and the call to action button was placed in the middle, not to be missed and also not to change
                    the position of other buttons, since it has a variable size, and in the original version it was
                    pushing the rest of the buttons to the right, confusing the users and making them click the wrong
                    action.</p>

                <h3>IMPROVED GENOTYPE TABLE</h3>

                <p>Some of the times, the genotype table would have a few tens of rows and it would become very hard to
                    review and modify, since all the rows looked pretty much the same.</p>

                <p>The first thing I did was to simplify and visually separate the rows as much as possible. That meant
                    removing the separators in the favor of visual grouping, reducing the height of the rows and hiding
                    the actions when they were not needed, showing them on demand, to the right side of the table.</p>

				<p>Another improvement was to make some sense of all the information at a single glance. The way users
					added another row in the table was by duplicating either an empty row, or a completed one. Most of
					the time it was the latter, some of the adjacent rows would be related and share
					some values. This meant there were some logical groupings hidden in there, and
					they matched the mental model the users had when filling in or verifying information. I gave users the possibility to color
					and move the rows so they can bring the groupings up to a visual layer.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Genotype table with simplified, more compact and better separated rows. The actions are visible only on demand." href="img/curation/after/6.finding%20form%20-%20genotype%20table%20-%20multiple%20rows.png"><img class="gallery3 left_image" id="curation_after_6" src="img/curation/after/6.finding%20form%20-%20genotype%20table%20-%20multiple%20rows.png" alt="" /></a>
				    <a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Option to color and move rows in order to create groups of rows that share similarities" href="img/curation/after/7.finding%20form%20-%20genotype%20table%20-%20multiple%20rows%20-%20grouping.png"><img class="gallery3 center_image" id="curation_after_7" src="img/curation/after/7.finding%20form%20-%20genotype%20table%20-%20multiple%20rows%20-%20grouping.png" alt="" /></a>
				    <a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Focused row that makes the context switches easier" href="img/curation/after/8.finding%20form%20-%20genotype%20table%20-%20multiple%20rows%20-%20focus.png"><img class="gallery3 right_image" id="curation_after_8" src="img/curation/after/8.finding%20form%20-%20genotype%20table%20-%20multiple%20rows%20-%20focus.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>The last improvement was making the focused row more visible, to also support context switches between
                    the screen and the written notes, and decrease mental load and chance of error.</p>

                <h3>IMPROVED NAVIGATION</h3>

                <p>Navigation also came up as an issue during the interviews, because the flow allowed users to
                    easily go only to the next unreviewed finding, which was a frequent action, but made
                    navigation to other areas more complicated.</p>

                <p>The solution I proposed was a breadcrumb bar at the top of the screen, visible all the time, with
                    no restrictions, so users can navigate to whatever part of the application they want.</p>

                <div class="gallery">
                    <a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Breadcrumb navigation with helpful information" href="img/curation/after/9.navigation%20findings.png"><img class="gallery2 left_image" id="curation_after_9" src="img/curation/after/9.navigation%20findings.png" alt="" /></a>
				    <a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Breadcrumb navigation with helpful information" href="img/curation/after/10.navigation%20articles.png"><img class="gallery2 right_image" id="curation_after_10" src="img/curation/after/10.navigation%20articles.png" alt="" /></a>
                </div>

                <p>I also decorated the options with additional information needed during navigation, like the
                    status of a finding, or the total number of findings of an article.</p>

                <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

                <p>This was a great research and design exercise and I got very positive feedback from the curators after
                    showing them the wireframes.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, the development team had other plans for the new UI and ignored most of my ideas.
