				<h1>CONTENT CURATION TOOL</h1>

				<h2>PROBLEM TO SOLVE</h2>
				<p>This is a redesign of a non-commercial content curation tool used to build a biological knowledge base with relations between genes and diseases.</p>
				
				<!-- show pictures of the previous version -->
				<a class="fancybox" rel="storyboards" title="Cooking a nice dinner" href="img/hci_project/hand drawn/cooking_storyboard_full_size.jpg"><img id="function_candidates_1" src="img/hci_project/hand drawn/cooking_storyboard_stripe.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				
				<!-- explain in a few words the main flows -->
				
				<p>The product has been used internally for a while with success but it has started to get more and more complaints once more users joined, the volume of work grew and the performance dropped.</p>
				<!-- explain the context of the redesign -->
				
				<p>After a period of complaints and also guided by longer term plans, the company decided to rewrite the whole thing. Even though most of the complaints were about performance, the UI was also redesigned and rewritten.</p>
				
				<p>Even though I had no previous involvement in the project, I saw this as an opportunity to practice my design skills and most importantly to observe and interview some of the users that were located in the same office as I.</p>

				<h2>USER RESEARCH</h2>
				
				<p>The goal of the user research was to understand the way users used the tool in their curation efforts and look for pain points or other opportunities of improvement.</p> 
				
				<p>So I asked three of the power users to walk me through their most frequent tasks and try to voice out what their were doing along the line. This was a great experience and I got to understand their logic and reasons behind their decisions and complaints much better. The sessions took no more than 45 minutes and they were conducted individually. This gave me to perfect context to ask the right questions and for them to open up and provide honest answers.</p>
				
				<!-- talk about the user research process and how it was conducted -->
				
				<p>Most of the findings followed a pattern but there were also specific things to each user.</p>
				<!-- talk about the the general knowledge gained about the tool, why, how and by how many it is used, describe it in a few words -->
				
				<!-- summarize the findings during the research, there is an email about this -->
				
				<!-- talk about the mental model of the users, their schedule, contract, way of getting paid, restrictions enforced by the company to limit careless work -->
				
				<h2>WIREFRAMES</h2>
				
				<p>After having a clearer idea of how I wanted the application to look like, I created a series of wireframes in order to communicate with the remote team I was working for and ask for their feedback.</p>
				
				<!-- mention balsamiq -->
				<!-- picture here -->
						
				<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
				<p>The wireframes were appreciated by the curators but the development team had other plans for the new UI</p>
