				<h1>CONTENT CURATION TOOL</h1>

				<h2>PROBLEM TO SOLVE</h2>

				<p>This is a redesign of a non-commercial content curation tool used to build a biological knowledge
					base with findings (relations between genes and diseases).</p>

				<p>The application would assign articles to the users and more than that, the articles would be pre
					scanned and analyzed by a natural language processing algorithm in order to extract and suggest the findings.
					So the users would need to read the articles and validate the findings discovered by the tool.
				</p>

				<!-- show pictures of the previous version -->
				<a class="fancybox" rel="curation tool before" title="Findings list" href="img/curation/before/snapshot-all%20findings.JPG"><img class="gallery2" id="curation_before_1" src="img/curation/before/snapshot-all%20findings.JPG" alt="" style="vertical-align: top;"/></a>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="curation tool before" title="Article" href="img/curation/before/snapshot-finding.JPG"><img class="gallery2" id="curation_before_2" src="img/curation/before/snapshot-above%20fold.jpg" alt="" /></a>

				<!-- explain in a few words the main flows -->

				<p>The product has been used internally for a while with success but it has started to get more and more
					complaints once more users joined, the volume of work grew and the performance dropped.</p>
				<!-- explain the context of the redesign -->

				<p>After a period of complaints and also driven by longer term plans, the company decided to rewrite the
					whole thing. Most of the complaints were about performance but the user interface was also redesigned
					and rewritten.</p>

				<p>Even though I had no previous involvement in the project, I saw this as an opportunity to practice my
					design skills and most importantly, to observe and interview some of the users that were located in
					the same office as me, so I volunteered to give it a try.</p>


				<h2>USER RESEARCH</h2>

				<p>The goal of the user research was to understand the way users used the tool in their curation efforts
					and look for pain points or other opportunities of improvement.</p>

				<p>So I asked three of the power users to walk me through their most frequent tasks and try to voice out
					what their were doing along the line. This was a great experience and I got to understand their
					logic and reasons behind their decisions and complaints much better. The sessions took no more than
					45 minutes and they were conducted individually. This gave me to perfect context to ask the right
					questions and for them to open up and provide honest answers.</p>

				<!-- talk about the user research process and how it was conducted -->

				<p>Most of the findings followed a pattern but there were also specific things to each user.</p>

				<p>One of the most interesting things was that most users would take notes on a piece of paper while
					reading an article and fill the forms in the application afterwards because this meant less context
					switches and it was less tiring.</p>

				<p>The things I learned from the interviews were:

				<ul class="article_list">
					<li>the purpose of the tool is fast data entry, the users wanted to spend as less time as possible
						using the tool
					</li>
					<li>most of the time was spent filling the forms and waiting for the application to respond</li>
					<li>a significant amount of time was spent doing reviews of the work to make sure the data is
						correct
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<!-- talk about the mental model of the users, their schedule, contract, way of getting paid, restrictions enforced by the company to limit careless work -->
				<p>The context of use was also interesting. Most curators were hired as contractors and mainly worked
					from home on their own schedule and were paid based on how much work they got done in a month. Some of
					them did this only part time as a second job, for some of them, this was their main job. This meant
					that some of them were using the application during the day, some during the night, some would sit
					down for hours, some for shorter periods, based on their schedule and needs.</p>

				<p>For a more detailed list of observations you can read the notes I took during the observation and interview sessions.</p>

				<h2>WIREFRAMES</h2>

				<p>Starting from the observations, I began to think of a design that would speed up the data entry,
					minimize the repetitive work, reduce vertical scrolling, improve navigation and also make the review
					process more enjoyable and less error prone.</p>

				<p>More than that, the new design would have to follow the current workflows as users were very familiar
					with the existing tool and slowing them down, even for a short period of time would mean less money for
					them.</p>

				<h3>Articles and Findings management</h3>

				<p>There was not much to change when it came to displaying lists of articles and findings. I did clean
					up the screens, removing the unnecessary lines and using visual groupings instead.</p>

				<a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Home screen" href="img/curation/after/1.homescreen.png"><img class="gallery2" id="curation_after_1" src="img/curation/after/1.homescreen.png" alt="" /></a>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Home screen" href="img/curation/after/2.display%20findings%20for%20article.png"><img class="gallery2" id="curation_after_2" src="img/curation/after/2.display%20findings%20for%20article.png" alt="" /></a>

                <p>The information layering was also improved by means of colors and typography and also by using icons
                    to make status of the findings more visible.</p>

                <h3>Repetitive work</h3>

                <p>The issues of repetitive work came up with every user I interviewed. There were a lot of times when
                    they would have wanted a way to pre fill the answers for multiple findings with the same answer.
                    This was also enforced
                    by the protocol since the management would not favor copy/paste jobs with the hope of reducing
                    careless work and errors. I found it interesting that the users cheated anyway by duplicating a completed finding,
                    modifying the required answers and rejecting the finding they were supposed to fill in the first
                    place.</p>
                <a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Home screen" href="img/curation/after/3.display%20findings%20for%20article%20-%20fill%20multiple%20findings.png"><img class="gallery1" id="curation_after_3" src="img/curation/after/3.display%20findings%20for%20article%20-%20fill%20multiple%20findings.png" alt="" /></a>

                <p>The solution I proposed involves propagating the answers of a completed finding to all the findings
                    selected from the table. By hovering one of the selected rows, an icon would show up to the right
                    and by clicking
                    the arrow you would get a popup with the option of selecting which answer to be multiplied.</p>

                <p>I think this is better than forcing the users to repeat some steps since this is proven by psychology
                    research to be a
                    recipe for mistakes.</p>

                <h3>The Finding form</h3>

                <p>This is the screen of the application that I was advised not to change. There were a few problems
                    with it nonetheless and I tried to fix them without impacting the users in a negative way.</p>

                <p>One of the things I did not like was the lack of visual hierarchy. I wanted to make the sections and
                    subsections more distinguishable to help context switches between the computer screen and the paper
                    notes most users took before filling in the form. I did this by using indentation, typography and by
                    moving the mandatory marks to the left so they would help the separation of the sections.</p>

                <p>The vertical scrolling was also a thing that came up a lot during research. I tried to fix this by
                    making better use of the horizontal space and by compressing the suggestions so that the sections
                    would become shorter. This is also
                    helping the visual separation.</p>

                <a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Home screen" href="img/curation/after/4.finding%20form%20-%20above%20fold.png"><img class="gallery1" id="curation_after_4" src="img/curation/after/4.finding%20form%20-%20above%20fold.png" alt="" /></a>

                <p>There is also a subtle change to the position of the buttons. The navigation buttons were moved to
                    the sides and the call to action button was placed in the middle, not to be missed and also not to change
                    the position of other buttons since it has a variable size and in the original version it was
                    pushing the rest of the buttons to the right, confusing the users and making them click the wrong
                    action.</p>

                <h3>Improved Genotype Table</h3>

                <p>Some of the times, the genotype table would have a few tens of rows and it would become very hard to
                    review and modify since all the rows looked pretty much the same.</p>

                <p>The first thing I did was to simplify and visually separate the rows as much as possible. That meant
                    removing the separators in the favor of visual grouping, reducing the height of the rows and hiding
                    the actions when they are not needed, showing them on demand to the right of the table.</p>

                <p>Another improvement was to make some sense of all the rows at a single glance. The way the users
                    added another row in the table was by duplicating either an empty row or a completed one. Most of
                    the time it was the latter, some of the adjacent rows would be related and share
                    some values. This means there are some logical groupings hidden in there and
                    they match the mental model of the users when filling in or verifying information and that gave me
                    the idea of making them visible. I did this by giving the users the possibility to color and move rows.</p>
                <a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Home screen" href="img/curation/after/6.finding%20form%20-%20genotype%20table%20-%20multiple%20rows.png"><img class="gallery3" id="curation_after_6" src="img/curation/after/6.finding%20form%20-%20genotype%20table%20-%20multiple%20rows.png" alt="" /></a>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Home screen" href="img/curation/after/7.finding%20form%20-%20genotype%20table%20-%20multiple%20rows%20-%20grouping.png"><img class="gallery3" id="curation_after_7" src="img/curation/after/7.finding%20form%20-%20genotype%20table%20-%20multiple%20rows%20-%20grouping.png" alt="" /></a>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Home screen" href="img/curation/after/8.finding%20form%20-%20genotype%20table%20-%20multiple%20rows%20-%20focus.png"><img class="gallery3" id="curation_after_8" src="img/curation/after/8.finding%20form%20-%20genotype%20table%20-%20multiple%20rows%20-%20focus.png" alt="" /></a>

                <p>The last improvement was making the focused row more visible to also support context switches between
                    the screen and the written notes and decrease mental load and chance of error.</p>

                <h3>Improved navigation</h3>

                <p>Navigation also came up as an issue during the interviews because the flow would force the users to
                    easily go only to the next unreviewed finding, which was a frequent action, but would make
                    navigation to other areas more complicated.</p>

                <p>The solution I proposed was a breadcrumb bar at the top of the screen, visible all the time and with
                    no restrictions so that the users can navigate to whatever part of the application they want.</p>
                <a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Home screen" href="img/curation/after/9.navigation%20findings.png"><img class="gallery2" id="curation_after_9" src="img/curation/after/9.navigation%20findings.png" alt="" /></a>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="curation after" title="Home screen" href="img/curation/after/10.navigation%20articles.png"><img class="gallery2" id="curation_after_10" src="img/curation/after/10.navigation%20articles.png" alt="" /></a>

                <p>I also decorated the options with additional information that is needed during navigation, like the
                    status of a finding or the total number of findings of an article.</p>

                <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

                <p>This was a great research and design exercise and the curators gave a very positive feedback after
                    seeing the wireframes.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, the development team had other plans for the new UI and ignored most of my proposals.
                    Even though we tried to convince the management to give this design a chance, they would just trust
                    the development team with any decision regarding this application.</p>
