				<h1>CONTENT CURATION TOOL</h1>

				<h2>PROBLEM TO SOLVE</h2>

				<p>This is a redesign of a non-commercial content curation tool used to build a biological knowledge
					base with findings (relations between genes and diseases).</p>

				<p>The application would assign articles to the users and more than that, the articles would be pre
					scanned and analyzed by a natural language processing algorithm in order to extract and suggest the findings.
					So the users would need to read the articles and validate the findings discovered by the tool.
				</p>

				<!-- show pictures of the previous version -->
				<a class="fancybox" rel="curation tool before" title="Findings list" href="img/curation/before/snapshot-all%20findings.JPG"><img class="gallery2" id="curation_before_1" src="img/curation/before/snapshot-all%20findings.JPG" alt="" style="vertical-align: top;"/></a>
				<a class="fancybox" rel="curation tool before" title="Article" href="img/curation/before/snapshot-finding.JPG"><img class="gallery2" id="curation_before_2" src="img/curation/before/snapshot-above%20fold.jpg" alt="" /></a>

				<!-- explain in a few words the main flows -->

				<p>The product has been used internally for a while with success but it has started to get more and more
					complaints once more users joined, the volume of work grew and the performance dropped.</p>
				<!-- explain the context of the redesign -->

				<p>After a period of complaints and also driven by longer term plans, the company decided to rewrite the
					whole thing. Most of the complaints were about performance but the user interface was also redesigned
					and rewritten.</p>

				<p>Even though I had no previous involvement in the project, I saw this as an opportunity to practice my
					design skills and most importantly, to observe and interview some of the users that were located in
					the same office as me.</p>


				<h2>USER RESEARCH</h2>

				<p>The goal of the user research was to understand the way users used the tool in their curation efforts
					and look for pain points or other opportunities of improvement.</p>

				<p>So I asked three of the power users to walk me through their most frequent tasks and try to voice out
					what their were doing along the line. This was a great experience and I got to understand their
					logic and reasons behind their decisions and complaints much better. The sessions took no more than
					45 minutes and they were conducted individually. This gave me to perfect context to ask the right
					questions and for them to open up and provide honest answers.</p>

				<!-- talk about the user research process and how it was conducted -->

				<p>Most of the findings followed a pattern but there were also specific things to each user.</p>

				<p>One of the most interesting things was that most users would take notes on a piece of paper while
					reading an article and fill the forms in the application afterwards because this meant less context
					switches and it was less tiring.</p>

				<p>The things I learned from the interviews were:

				<ul class="article_list">
					<li>the purpose of the tool is fast data entry, the users wanted to spend as less time as possible
						using the tool
					</li>
					<li>most of the time was spent filling the forms and waiting for the application to respond</li>
					<li>a significant amount of time was spent doing reviews of the work to make sure the data is
						correct
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<!-- talk about the mental model of the users, their schedule, contract, way of getting paid, restrictions enforced by the company to limit careless work -->
				<p>The context of use was also interesting. Most curators were hired as contractors and mainly worked
					from home on their own schedule and were paid based on how much work they got done in month. Some of
					them did this only part time as a second job, for some of them, this was their main job. This meant
					that some of them were using the application during the day, some during the night, some would sit
					down for hours, some for shorter periods, based on their schedule and needs.</p>

				<p>For a more detailed list of observations you can read the notes I took from the users I observed and interviewed.</p>

				<span id="more_observations">

										insertion work (just to do less context switches)
									</li>
									<li>stressed the importance of having a way to pre populate some fields</li>
									<li>finding view, reduce scrolling, the hands starts to numb after a few hours</li>
									<li>finding view, suggestions for some fields can be removed after a value has been
										chosen, still needed for corrections and for hovering
									</li>
									<li>finding view, sections need to be visible all the time since changes are seldom
										made (collapse/expand behavior not needed)
									</li>
									<li>finding view, a better separation between sections would help</li>
									<li>genotype table, some columns are complementary and can be shown individually
										(the ones that are grayed out in the current design)
									</li>
									<li>genotype table, duplicated items can be grouped for review purpose</li>
									<li>genotype table, sense of focus would help not to lose track when transferring
										the data from the paper sheet (word document) in the application

									<li>finding view, duplication button in the genotype table messes up the layout</li>
									<li>finding view, judgement drop down, options can be grouped</li>

				<h2>WIREFRAMES</h2>
				
				<p>After having a clearer idea of how I wanted the application to look like, I created a series of wireframes in order to communicate with the remote team I was working for and ask for their feedback.</p>

				<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
				<p>The wireframes were appreciated by the curators but the development team had other plans for the new UI</p>
